# Hotel-Reviews-with-Gen-AI-Snowflake
This repo contains my files for the project called analysing hotel reviews with Cortext AI in Snowflake.

# Project Description

If I am hired as a data scientist at a global hotel chain, Executive Resorts. I will be working with Snowflake Notebooks in my new role, applying Snowflake Cortex to streamline workflows.

The Executive Resorts is a global hotel chain. Their database contains hotel reviews - including the rating, review text, review language, and other features. We'll use Cortex to perform various tasks on this data, showcasing Snowflake's powerful generative AI functionality!

# Tech Stack:
Python, SQL, Snowflake


# Questions to Answer
1. How many reviews exist for Executive Resorts hotels in Mexico and other cities?
2. The regional manager in Cannes is keen to streamline the workflow for analyzing customer reviews with generative AI skills.

   2.1 The regional manager for Switzerland wants your help classifying recent negative reviews to identify common problems and develop action plans. They've provided predefined categories for classifying reviews, so you can build an automated classification pipeline.
   
   2.2 You've been asked to help the Hyatt Regency Palais hotel understand customer's sentiment. Due to a pipeline issue in September 2023, all ratings were assigned randomly during that period, making sentiment analysis essential for understanding actual customer feelings.

3. You've been asked by the regional team at Executive Resorts to help them review guest feedback submitted in Spanish. Many of their hotels in Mexico receive high volumes of non-English reviews, and they want to ensure this valuable insight isn't overlooked. You will work on translate reviews, extract answers from text, and chain multiple function.
