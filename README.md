# Hotel-Reviews-with-Gen-AI-Snowflake
This repo contains my files for the project called analysing hotel reviews with Cortext AI in Snowflake.

# Project Description

If I am hired as a data scientist at a global hotel chain, Executive Resorts. I will be working with Snowflake Notebooks in my new role, applying Snowflake Cortex to streamline workflows.

The Executive Resorts is a global hotel chain. Their database contains hotel reviews - including the rating, review text, review language, and other features. We'll use Cortex to perform various tasks on this data, showcasing Snowflake's powerful generative AI functionality!


# Questions to answer
1. How many reviews exist for Executive Resorts hotels in Mexico and other cities?
2. The regional manager in Cannes is keen to streamline the workflow for analyzing customer reviews and has asked you to apply your generative AI skills for this task!

# Steps
1. Create a database named "hotel_reviews" with one table "hotel_reviews"
2. Create a notebook
3. Install python package: snowflake-ml-python
4. Analysing with Python and SQL
