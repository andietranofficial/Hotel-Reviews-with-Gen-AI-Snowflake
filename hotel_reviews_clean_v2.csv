2023-09-18,10,We've been to Cancun 5 times; and this time was by far the best thanks to all the staffs at Grand Fiest Americana Beach Coral hotel. Their food espeically the fried whole fish at Isla Contoy; Sashimi at Torii; Pizza and Pasta at the italian restaurant; and authentic mexican cuisine at La Hoya were just AMAZING. We honestly thought about extending our stay because of food. They clean room almost 2-3 times  a day and make sure everything is shiny and spotless when we came back from outside activities. Servers and all the staff were soooo friendly and had smile on their face at all time! We miss it already. I have a feeling that we will be back soon. lol,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-09-07,8,Property overall is good; the private beach area is very small. Some book half of the area on the beach for private events or 3 days in a row and that leaves you with pretty much very small area to sit and enjoy the beach. Other good spots on the beach either reserved or needs reservation.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-09-07,6,The two people working at Cafe Urbano were wonderful! We first went to Caribeño a couple of times to order a la carte which in those two days we almost paid $200 the next day we tried to eat breakfast the lady at the front told us it was better for us to go to Cafe Urbano because that breakfast was for all you can eat $30 per per and we said what? So we stopped going there; also had a bad experience when we paid $300 for an excursion at the hotel after we told the lady we had medical problems she still sold us and excursion that was not for us so I feel that I paid $300 to just drink water; eat;sit and watch everyone have a good time that was a big disappointment. We did report this before we left to management.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-09-04,10,The pool and beach at this hotel are gorgeous. Possibly one of the most beautiful beaches in Cancun. Free kayaks and paddle boards were a plus and loved by our family. The hotel itself is dated for sure and definitely requires renovations. Most of the decor appears to be tired and from the 80s; which is unfortunate since the outside of the hotel is so beautiful. Rooms are great with comfortable beds and the most amazing ocean views. The food was amazing from start to finish. Breakfast buffet was great and the Mexican restaurant had some of the best food we have ever had. All of the staff are wonderful and very attentive. Besides the decor; my only other complaint would be that this hotel lacks entertainment by the pool. I wish there was more for kids that was not at the kids club. We like to keep our kids with us and they enjoy activities by the pool; but this hotel lacked that. Otherwise we had a wonderful time.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-09-04,10,I had a great day! It’s probably one of my most favorite vacations in a long time. I had an amazing room with the ocean view and a nice bathtub. My only complaint was that I got a room with two queen beds the first night in a lot of things were missing from the room. They were the handful of people that worked at the bar with the swing that was not very kind of professional; and one front desk person that was not great. Everyone else was amazing. In particular; the people in the urban bar upstairs were great. The two tile guys who did the excursions by the pool were amazing the servers at the cabanas and lounge on the beach was amazing. The people in the outdoor buffet for a great; the man on the indoor buffet was not so great. The managers worked hard to make everything right and we’re super amazing.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-09-02,10,Where do I start? The service is absolutely amazing. Never had 1 problem the entire 7 day stay. I’ve been to a lot of resorts in Cancun and the food is always so so. Here; the food was outstanding. Me and my 3 other guest who are really into good food loved it. Even the room service food was great. I also loved how they served corona and modelo. If you sit at the beach you can get a server all day long. As long as you tip he will be right back every 20 minutes. I highly recommend going to all the resturants and using the omelette bar for breakfast. The king bed ocean room view is perfect. Comfortable and nice and cold. No issues in the room. Room service comes twice a day. This is by far the best resort I’ve been too in Cancun.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-09-02,10,This property was a beautiful clean property with the best beach in the area. The food at the beach bar was delicious and the drinks were delicious. There was excellent customer service. Only problem I had was with the front desk staff that made me wait way too long for my room to be ready despite calling them in advance and letting them know about my short stay and early arrival. I would stay there again and probably take a flight that arrives closer to 3pm check in.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-08-27,2,I stayed two nights at this hotel The second night around 10:30 pm; an authorized person came into my room while my wife and kids were sleeping. We called the front desk immediately; who told us that they would check the security cameras and change our room keys. The next day at check out; we asked about the incident. The receptionist had no information about the incident; she apologized for the incident and gave us a $15 discount for our troubles. We were not looking for compensation but rather for an explanation of how an unauthorized person could enter our room while we were sleeping. In the next few weeks; I follow up with the hotel to find out about this incident. Someone from the hotel chain reached out asking for my phone number to call me but never did The incident was terrible but the response from the hotel was even worse.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-08-25,10,"We had an amazing time during our stay at Grand Fiesta Americana. Housekeeping cleaned our room twice a day. Every area of the property were kept clean and well-maintained; including the restrooms; even the ones in the pool area. The staff were all very friendly and professional; always greeted you with a smile. Bryan helped check us in and out during our stay; very professional; friendly and humorous. We really liked the food at the pool-side bar and at the restaurants; La Joya; Torii; and the Steakhouse. The Mariachi band in La Joya was fun to listen to while we had our dinner. My daughters loved it when they played Un Poco Loco; which they remembered from the movie ""Coco."" There was a fairly nice selection of breakfast items at the indoor breakfast buffet. The dining staff were all excellent. We were always seated quickly and served in a timely manner. The pools and beaches are also very clean with beautiful; relaxing; scenic views. We went snorkeling twice through the Coral Marine Beach company provided by the hotel; which was very fun. The captains; Orlando and Lorenzo; were very friendly and helpful. Orlando was patient and professional when teaching us how to snorkel and guiding us around the reef; pointing out where to look for fish; sea turtles; corals and underwater statues. Same with Nikki; our skipper who took beautiful pictures/videos for us. Lorenzo was very experienced; and quickly spotted a pair of dolphins.

2023-08-23,2,I will never book a vacation through Expedia not only did I pay over 5;000 dollars but they false advertise the resort; in my reservation It clearly stated that breakfast and dinner was included.  When I got to the resort they informed me that these issues have happed before with Expedia because the resort does not offer an all exclusive.  After flighting practically all day I called Expedia and they had me on hold for 45min and nothing got resolved.  I ended up spending over 1000.00 more just on food.  I am beyond me they are not only false advertising but refused to take any responsibility on their part for the issues they caused me and my family.

Also the food was delicious.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-08-11,8,this hotel is good; location is excellent but beach is small and next to it there is a public beach. The kids pool/water park; which is what we were interested in; is located inside the kids room and can only be accessed at certain times. My kids complained about this and we had thought it was outside and accessible at all times. Restaurants require reservations and if you want specific times; good luck; some may be full 5 nights in advance. Same for the boat to isla mujeres; by the time we saw the ad; it was already full. Overall it is a good hotel with good food,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-08-08,8,Definitivamente no es el mejor hotel pero estuvo bien ; la amabilidad de su staff es inmejorable; deberían de indicar que el restaurante con el logo azul es un restaurante que no tiene los mismos métodos que los demás ; la comida en dicho restaurante le petit … algo así ; estuvo por demás desagradable ; sin sabor ; y excesivamente cara ; como cliente llegas a pasar una estancia en ese restaurante muy desagradable. Mis felicitaciones a un camarero de nombre Raymundo o Reynaldo del restaurante caribeño ; no recuerdo bien su nombre ; fue súper atento y con muy buenas opciones de comida .

I would I would recommend this property to other people if they are planning their vacation in Cancun.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-08-01,10,we got an excellent experience with GFACB from its over all location (very safe; beach area was entirely private); staff interactions (very professional & accommodating:dnt 4gt tips) room conditions (very large and AC was blasting cold) dining options (we got reservations for dinner every night and was top notch); water activities (enjoyed the jetski and kayak) nightly entertainment (mexican fiesta; fire show; 24k magic; lobby band; late night adult party) the food (very delicious; none in our group have upset stomach or some sort; we are always full); the drinks (very good drinks from virgin drinks to alcohol choices; drinking water from glass was very safe); kids club (neutral); the pool (beautiful and large; a bit warm but its summer) and the beach (thankfully it cleared out compared to the 2 weeks prior of visit due to sargassum). we indeed have a blast and it seems the planets were all aligned with our vacation. All of our request was accommodated like having our 3 rooms next to each other (was even near to elevators; buffet area and exit towards pool) and changing dinner time to be able to attend the 9pm show and etc..  We are all glad choosing GFACB for our very first all inclusive Cancun vacation in which it raised the bar to high. The reviews stands and were never wrong with us based on our experience. we would really like to come back soon. we are a party of 10; 6 adults and 4 kids from DFW Texas area and our couple visitor from the Netherlands:  4 night 5 days stay,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-07-31,10,Amazing experience; Fiesta Americana Coral Beach Cancun has been the one of the best all inclusive resorts that I have ever been. All staff was very professional and  super friendly. The food was really good; the buffet had a lot of variety including Korean and Indian food. The seafood was great; especially the shrimps. My room was always clean and had a great ocean view. The beach was nice; even though there were not a lot of free beds with umbrellas; the hotel employees always helped me to find a bed and an umbrellla. I had the beach dinner experience; and iw was fabulous. I completely recommend that experience.  Great pool; plenty of space for adults and for kids. The kids club had personal trained for autistic kids which I think is great. In conclusion; i will definitely come back again.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-07-30,6,stay was overall ok; didn’t like communication with reception also the word GRAND is for the beach name which is grand coral resort has nothing to do with Grand. Restaurants are always full for the booking so we ended up eating at the common buffet for most of our stay. We booked two family and friends suits room. They ended up giving us 4 bedrooms.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-07-30,4,We paid more to stay in this hotel due to the kids pool area; amenities and reviews however once there; the gym was closed and in construction; kids pool area inactive (picture taken from the top of the hotel and the kids pool section is closed). The room had drainage issue in the bathtub and sink and took them 2 days to try to fix it without success. We kept requesting to change room without success and gave up to avoid further stress. Food was ok but not the best. The daily activity journal we only received on the last two days (we stayed 5 days) and on the date of the activity that makes you loose the morning free activity if you are interested. I would suggest to put the journal on the day before in the room when they set up the beds. The beach area is restricted and if you like to have a walk; choose another hotel. Overall unfortunately; I would not recommend the hotel that is pricey for what they offer.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-07-29,10,This was a great property.  The staff was delightful.  ALWAYS smiling; friendly and accommodating.  Food was good.  If you’re dining at the restaurants on site; be sure to make reservations upon arrival.  Pool was clean; and never overcrowded.  Private beach area was beautiful and had the most amazing views.  We were upgraded upon arrival and treated like family. There were nightly events and plenty of things for kids to do.

2023-07-28,2,I did not receive any benefit at this VIP property while my non member companion did. They are not accommodating when it comes to dining service. The food at the buffet felt like it was also used  in the individual restaurants. This hotel is more geared towards family oriented guest and should be in its heading. Location is great.

2023-07-26,6,One star for kids club; one star for the pool and one star for the view. Hotel is old; and the venting system in the room is too loud specially while sleeping. Food is just so so although seafood in general is fresh. Very slow service but it’s understandable that it’s just post-pandemic so they may still play catch-up. Some hotel staff just have the wrong attitude towards the customers; and arrogant in many ways. Poor communication too. Would recommend to consider other all-inclusive resorts for family with younger children.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-07-26,10,Good services ; nice and friendly staff . Cleanliness !,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-07-26,6,The resort was okay.  The check in was a nightmare and took 3 hours. Once we got into our room; the view was gorgeous but the  room had mirrors that had black spots all over it. The restaurants are nice but I had to create a fuss before I got actual reservations before 9pm  and when we did go to our reservations at 6:30/7 the restaurants were half empty so I don’t understand why they couldn’t give us the reservations to begin with. Selma and Antonio were amazing pool hosts but we had a hard time tracking down the activities and times of the activities. We had signed up for a paint class but when we got there it was already filled with others. So it was more like a first come first served. They also have a free ride to isla mujeres but no one tells you anything; there is no list of activities anywhere and the reservations at dinners are next to impossible to get unless you make a fuss. It seems like they are trying to do the minimum at this resort when every other resort in Cancun is really trying their best to ensure you have a good time- at fiesta Americana they just want to get you in the door and then do nothing else. Chantal; one of the waitresses at the pool was awesome. She was able to help us get lunch without me having to track her down; that was nice. Other employees seem to run away from you and avoid eye contact.  We’ve stayed at the fiesta Americana in puerta Vallarta and it was a million times better than this place. I wouldn’t go back to this resort.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-07-26,6,Just kinda typical Mexico resort. Wristbands and they try and shove you into the buffet by making it very difficult to get reservations at the nice restaurants. We made our reservations the moment we arrived and never ate before 8pm.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-07-26,10,I am so glad that I picked this hotel; it was hard to pick a place since there were so many options! It was my first time in Cancun! So I had no idea where should I picked; glad that I made the right choice. Close to everything; shopping and attraction! The staffs are so nice; not sure how did the hotel knew that my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary; they surprised us with Chocolate Covered Strawberries and a $100  bottle of wine in our room. We also try their spa Ikeal the experience was amazing very trained staffs. They are also have water activities free of charge and their breakfast is so good.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-07-21,8,All staff were friendly and professional.  The bar/restaurant only had one server between the two and he was excellent considering he was alone and had to cover many people.  The restaurant dinner was good. The rooms need updating and are kind of small; at least mine was but it had AC. It worked OK but never got as cool as the temp indicator would presume. But it’s across the street from the train station and a quick walk to the river area and old town.  I would still stay there again.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

2023-07-16,10,I was very impressed with this hotel; especially the service. They make you feel special and you feel like everything is possible. Special shout out to the Kidz Club staff. Our daughter is very picky and for the first time; she begged to go back there. They have a great supervision and they let the kids do fun activities such as cooking classes and crafting. The food was really good (buffet offered a different choice everyday). The all-inclusive program is really worth the price. They have good brands when it comes to drinks and they have a cute little cafe where you can get ice cream; pastries and sandwiches between the meals. The beach was beautiful and the thing that amazed me the most was the staff's ability to offer alternative options that are better than what you wanted/expected. Now that we are back home; it felt like a little dream. Kudos to everyone involved in the success of this hotel. Definitely coming back in 2024.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-07-14,8,This is a solid 4 out of 5-star experience. For an all-inclusive; they do have the best food and drink out there. I've stayed at other resorts in Cancun that were all-inclusive (including a 5-star resort) and this had better food and beverage. The rooms are very clean but are aging with looks and modernness. The beach is on the smaller side; has small waves good for swimming; and is well-maintained. Unfortunately; Cancun is experiencing a major seaweed problem now (not the resort's fault of course); which makes the water discolored from crystal clear aqua blue; to dark brown. The pool is gigantic; clean; and a very nice way to spend your day. The staff is very helpful and nice. The location is perfect. You are just steps away from the strip where a lot of the clubs; bars; and restaurants are located. I would come back here again.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

Pools were clean and large. My only gripe would be the bathrooms are a bit dingy and dated. Even a simple recaulk and faucet replacement would go a long way as you see rust and staining. Don’t get me wrong; it’s as clean as possible by the cleaning staff; the materials are just worn. Also humid rooms compared to other places I’ve stayed in - maybe needs better circulation? None of these would deter me from returning however. Overall great place to stay.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-06-03,10,Property is a little old yet spotless; well maintained; food was really good. I have been to a bunch of all inclusives ; know im not complaing im giving constructive criticism;  there needs to be a pool for the adults where there are NO KIDS AT THE BAR; its a bad look for most; its a bar; being restrictive to some guests helps other guests; then they both enjoy. The infinite club and perks were awesome ; my guy Carlos at the sundeck was awesome. Restaurants were great; Le Basilia was amazing please do it; we met a higher up.in the elevator who was great an informed us there are 3 new restaurants coming an Italian dining experience with live music(opera;classical); a asian with live cooking tables; and a n steakhouse; So this place is a new go to; come enjoy the Grand Fiesta Americana Coral Beach; you wont regret it.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-06-02,2,DONT STAY HERE. INSECTS IN THE BED. If I could share ZERO stars; I would. I checked into this hotel on the night of 29 May. I was escorted to a room with a door smaller than the rest of the rooms in the hallway; only wide enough for my one checked luggage to fit through. I requested to be moved to the proper room; which they obliged; but only after claiming this was technically an upgrade (IT WASNT — it is the room I originally paid for. A classic room). Nonetheless; i didnt complain. As I got ready for bed; I moved the pillows and blanket out of place only to find 8-10 small insects buried underneath (see photo of what it looked like). These insects also flew on me throughout the night. I called the reception and told them id like to check out and request a refund and they said I would have to handle this with Expedia; who I booked and prepaid the four nights with. There were also no available hotels at that time for me to go to (it was midnight). I waited until day break and went down to the reception to tell them what happened. They very nonchalantly told me there were flies during this time of year. Upon calling expedia to resolve the matter and get my money back for the nights i didnt stay there; the hotel refused. DONT STAY HERE unless you want bugs in your hair and clothes. I’m still waiting for Expedia to get back to me on resolving the issue. So disappointed in how well this hotel is rated on Expedia.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

2023-06-01,10,Grand Fiesta Americana offered a very relaxed and memorable experience for our family. The service was amazing from the maintenance of the property (our room was cleaned twice a day and we always had fresh towels; robes; and even hotel slippers). Food met beyond our expectations from 24 hr room service to the a lactarte restaurants and buffet which made our stay a lot more seamless travelling with a 10 month old and toddler. All rooms are beach front with breathtaking views; comfortable beddings; and very spacious rooms. The beach was crystal blue with white sand. The hotel provided enough umbrellas and beach chairs at no extra cost. The resort provided a more relaxed and family feel however; it is in the centre of restaurants; night clubs; and market. Only thing missing in the resort is entertainment during the day and evening; especially late evening for the night owls.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-05-31,4,"There is a huge tower block being built next to the hotel which not only blocks the view but is also very noisy. The staff are very attentive if you are wearing Prada or Armani but less so if not (we tested this out). The pool loungers cost €220 a day! The pool also has constant Euro pop playing.

2023-05-28,8,Arriving and checking in was great; once you walk-in seems so peaceful and clean.  Breakfast was loved by my daughters they loved their chilaquiles I loved my omelettes!  Orange juice was delicious tastes fresh everyday!  I disliked that they state some restaurants like the Italian no need for reservation; my daughters and I get there since they were craving it since we got there and reservation was needed…. Finally did reservations for the Mexican restaurant and Tuscany.  Mexican restaurant was great; delicious and a nice mariachi !  Waiter got the mariachi to sing Las mañanitas and he did this really nice show with fire to end the night!  Two thumbs up!!  Tuscany on the other hand lacked flavor and service not to mention over an hour to get our food.  My daughter started feeling sick after tasting their salad.  She wanted to vomit went to the restroom after it.  As she returned she tried eating their food but it wasn’t what we expected.  As mentioned service was not so good maybe since the day before the Mexican restaurant was just great and were expecting the same.  Their pizza was good but the rest was just not so great.  Earlier that day I also thought it was weird that one of their entrance employees trough his headset told someone that an Arab person and 2 ladies were waking down the Hotel… I don’t know just thought it was weird and made me uncomfortable after that….  Overall the pool was great the food was good; the beach was nice and great service at their breakfast,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-04-26,4,RUN from this resort!! What a scam. The property itself is very nice and the beach was fine; but a huge ripoff. Paid almost $3k for 2.5 days. Room size was nice; but unnecessary. Was supposed to come with a bottle of wine; but never delivered. Our group paid $1k extra for a private birthday dinner on the beach. They made up lies and sat us 10 steps away in the same restaurant we ate at the night before and refused to refund our money. EXACT same food as the night before. We had some cheap Dollar Store balloons that were put up. And a cake; but its all inclusive and the same deserts were everywhere. The only good food was breakfast. Lunch was ehh. And dinner was awful all 3 nights. Barely ate anything but bread after breakfast. The drinks were acceptable; but nothing amazing like we've had at other resorts. There are much better choices in Cancun.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-04-23,8,The property overall was kept very clean and was beautiful.  The amenities were plentiful. The room service was okay / good. The La Joya restaurant was amazing. My complaints are the bed wasn’t the most comfortable. Also; rather than concierge handling everything for you there was a separate concierge for everything. Transportation; activities; pool rentals; etc. So; you had to chase down different people which was a hassle. I wish the resort would have sent me an email prior to arrival with all of this information so that dinner; events; transportation and rentals could have been booked in advance. They require booking dinner reservations a day in advance so when I arrived in my bday I couldn’t have dinner anywhere. They require transportation reservations 2 days prior. Which I had no idea about so that was an issue. Send people your requirements so we know what to do. We have never been to your resort before so how should we know?!  That was the most frustrating part. But we still had a nice; relaxing time.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

Their private beach is stunning. We were in the middle of all the fun stuff in Cannes; which allowed us to walk to our desired destination every single day.

2023-04-08,8,I enjoyed my stay.  It was a few small things that I found disappointing.  For example my room over looked the main road and the paint was cracking off the building.  Some of the tiles in the bathroom / shower were chipped.  Its all the small cosmetic things that showed that routine maintenance wasn't a priority.  Over all very nice stay would I come back sure.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-04-06,8,We loved the building and the renovation/restoration work. However there were two small issues; the tea and coffee facilities were mean; no milk; limited choice of drinks (often not replacing what we had used) and erratic times of when the room was serviced.,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France,en

2023-03-30,10,Our 5 night stay was excellent. The hotel is well staffed and you feel taken care of at all times. There are staff doing service for drinks and food at the pool; giving you warm towels as you enter the hotel after your swim; and to place a napkin on your lap every time you sit for dinner. Staff are constantly cleaning - scrubbing the pool chairs and tiles every morning; clear long tables at dinner and there is not a piece of garbage on property. The rooms are clean; spacious and comfortable for sleeping and relaxing in the air conditioning. Lots of space to store items; a mini fridge that is stocked; and a safe. The pools are warm (78-80*) and have plenty of seating with swim up bars where the staff happily serve your child as many strawberry non-alcoholic daiquiris as they can hold in their bellies. The beach - OMG! So large; no seaweed; and beautiful white sand leading to crystal clear water. The view from our room on the 10th floor was amazing and allowed us to watch the nightly entertainment if it was in the beach or in the pool. There’s an arcade room that was well kept up and had plenty of video and tabletop games for families to play. The food was great at every restaurant. You always have access to the buffet which had many hot and cold options; clean and had a different theme of food each meal. We loved Tuscany the Italian spot and we paid up to eat at the Mediterranean restaurant that featured a set menu for adults. We LOVED all. Great location and will return!!,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-03-10,10,Very very picky person with cleanness;food;beach;views. All of these is excellent.. only place I didn’t like is Italian restaurant; breakfast in the morning is not disappointing at all; by the beach pool areas you have person making gyros and tacos; also at the cabanas by the pool area you can order food from the kitchen; for fit guy person that working out you have a gym that is not that bad to get your workouts at; there’s no protein so you will have to eat to replace the protein shakes there’s no protein bars. Jet ski are so fun $65 for half hour you will have a blast. First thing when you get there is you book every day dinner with front staff at the desk.. so if you are a big eater and want to eat later at the night save Somme food from the evening at night you cannot order food. There’s a super market bigger than Walmart across the street. You can get anything you want from there. For washing clothes they charge  $70 for one shirt that is ridiculous expensive. Hanging clothes on the balcony. Is not allowed unless you do it at night they watch you like hungry eagle be careful right there. Other than that everything is on point. They also charge resort daily fee for 5 days is like $23 not to bad.( the restaurants are all good except the Italian avoid that one),Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-03-09,10,My husband and I spent 4 nights here to celebrate my birthday. It was a wonderful trip! We went to the spa (great massage!); went snorkeling (not too many fish; but lots of fun); took a tequila-tasting and margarita-making class poolside (tasty!); enjoyed room-service; pool-service; and lots of food and drinks. The staff could not be more accommodating. There was always someone around to offer you assistance. Everything was clean; even the bathrooms by the pool. We ate at the French restaurant and it was well worth the $100 surcharge. All of the food we had at the resort was delicious; especially the dinners at La Hoya and the Italian restaurant. I would return in a heartbeat!,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-03-06,8,Good hotel; great location!  The breakfast buffet was very good and certainly worth the upcharge.  My only complaint was the lack of temperature control in the room.  I and others in my party complained of the same problem.  The thermostat on the wall did not seem to work and consequently it was a bit on the warm side. The saving grace was the the fact that you open a vent style window to cool it down.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

2023-02-23,10,The staff were all very pleasant; hotel is clean and safe. The only thing that you may want to consider is asking for a room away from the terrace if you have kids that sleep early. They had a few events with very loud music that started at 7pm and went until 10 and my child’s bedtime is 7pm. There is also not much to do for younger kids that can’t go to the kids club. I did use their paid nanny service; TOTALLY worth it Yolanda and Karina were awesome with my 17 month old.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-02-23,4,The Hotel property was spectacular.   The shuttle service that expedia provided was not.  I spent over $100 in transportation to and from airport and Expedia only reimbursed me $51.21.

The buffet food was standard all-inclusive food and the specialty restaurants were average with exception of the Italian place; it was excellent! We did not try the French restaurant as we did not want to pay the up-charge. The rooms were very nice but definitely needed some TLC.

2023-01-29,8,The staff were great; and I had an easy check-in and check-out. The private beach; swimming pool; and gym were all good; and the breakfast was delicious! The only thing which could have been better was the cleanness. There was a bad smell in my room; and to get rid of it I had to put the air conditioner to a low temperature to always work (otherwise it wouldn’t work). I noticed a few dirt on the floor which could have been removed by mopping. The was also a bitter unpleasant smell in the corridor.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-01-28,8,The amenities were good. The food / dinner of 3 restaurants were not good. Italian restaurant  was the worst. Doughy dough like someone bought frozen pizza and steam bake it no flavor.

2023-01-26,8,The property has an amazing beach on very sheltered and quiet spot of Cancun. The hotel public area and restaurant are good and spacious; rooms are great but in need of some upgrade as pretty dated; especially the bathrooms. Hotel staff very polite and helpful; Mexican hospitality at its best.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-01-26,2,This is a horrible hotel. We requested a different room as our room had a terrible smell and the hotel did not give us another room. In addition; the air conditioning was not working properly. They came 3 times to fix it but it was never fixed and we still stay at the same room. The hotel is far from anything. Stay somewhere else if you can.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-01-24,6,The hotel is quite dated. There was damp smell in the room and heating wasn't working probably. Called the reception around 8pm and they said they would send someone to check the heater. Yet no one turned up. Glad we only had to stay for a night.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en
2023-01-23,8,Location is great. Huge outdoor pools. Food is okay. They do have a complimentary ferry that takes you to Islas mujeres for free ( just check which days are free).,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-01-23,10,Property was central to restos; market tours and convenience stores within walking distance. All the staff were genuinely friendly; helpful and greeted you with smiles. Staff was able to get us early check-in. The food was great at hotel with a variety of options. Buffet breakfast had a vast selection! Don’t miss out on the message at the spa and do the jacuzzi. The resort had its own private beach with white sand. Overall; an awesome experience. It’s my first time in Cancun and definitely not the last.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-01-21,10,Absolutely Great!,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-01-20,10,3rd time staying on property; however; the first since they went all inclusive. I was worried the quality would be effected by that but in NO way did it feel like less than the best. If I had one negative it would be that you can’t get local lobster on-site. I would have gladly paid for a “upgrade” at one of their locations to have been able to enjoy the local lobster.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-01-20,8,The setting of the resort was beautiful but there wasn’t much to do especially for kids. There were no activities set up by the hotel. Other than that it was a very nice resort. The service was excellent and the food was good,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2023-01-15,10,This my second year in a row and my wife’s third year in a row at this facility.  We like that it is quite and geared towards families.  The beach is the best around. Food is excellent.  People are great. Only concern is that it’s supposed to be Non Smoking and it’s not enforced around palapa; pool or beach areas. Hard to get fresh air when smokers are around us no matter where we moved.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-01-14,8,Everything was excellent except the condition of the room which is not for 4star hotel.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en
2023-01-13,10,I’ve stayed at this hotel 7 times; but this is my 1st time since they switched to all inclusive. Not much has changed; the food is still good; the hotel is beautiful; and the staff is stIll EXCEPTIONAL! The beach is the best in Cancun as it sits on top of the 7 where the ocean us calm. They’ve also upped their game with nightly entertainment which is a huge plus. I wasn’t a fan of the bracelet we had to wear all week; wish they could figure out a better system. Its annoying to sunbathe with it on. My only other gripe is in regards to tipping. All week; I watched other guests dine & drink; and never leave a tip. All inclusive does NOT mean that you don’t have to leave a tip! The staff goes above & beyond and they work so hard. I blame this partly on the hotel because its impossible to get change. We asked the front desk twice to change out our $100’s for smaller bills; and they said that they don’t do that. They wouldn’t even give us pesos. How do you expect guests to tip the staff? If you stay here; please bring lots of $1’s and $5’s as there is no other way to tip your amazing staff.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2023-01-13,8,Personal touch in room and around hotel. Example; two types of robes; slippers and other items one might forget to pack. Friendly staff. Steak night was good. Dining option were great. Buffer items were often cold. Paid a large service fee but   Realized tipping was necessary to receive excellent customer service for food and drink at the pool and beach. Recommend Spa massages; truly amazing; was approached by staff to purchase timeshare. Overall; I enjoyed the beautiful hotel. Biggest complaint was that food was cold on several occasions.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-12-18,6,"Be careful when booking this hotel.  Call first to find out if they are doing any repairs or painting or in our case VARNISHING.  The fumes from varnishing was so strong as if it was coming through the air ducts directly into our room on the fifth floor.  We endured this for 2 days until the supervisor switched us to a different room.  We paid for a club level then had to move to a basic room in the tower.  Their commercial shows a high level of customer service and ""Luxury"".  There front desk staff is NOT trained to handle situations like this for a SUPPOSED world class hotel.  I have stayed here before and noticed that basically guest are supposed to accept whatever inconveniences arise and without any warnings....It's so unprofessional and it shows NO CLASS....they were even bleaching the pool area walkway while we were walking to have dinner and stepping on the bleached water they were rinsing....and this was early in the evening...they could have done that later when everyone was asleep like other resorts do....Anyway;  My last stay has left me confused now on how this place should be rated.  Was it  a down time so they have to do some repairs or touch-ups but what about the guest who stay during those down times?  And they waited to give us another room...and had to settle for a basic room when I paid more for our club level room and the problem was caused by the hotel....Be careful with this hotel everyone!",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-11-08,6,I would give it a general OK.  As soon as we checked in we were whisked away by the rewards Live Aqua folks to try to get us to sign up for their fiesta americana program.  I kepts saying no thank you but every morning for the first three days he would come grab us the moment we stepped off the elevators trying to persuade us with free massages and such.  We traveled with a small child and did not want to buy into whatever he was selling.  They stopped trying the last two days of our vacation.  Food was nice but we had reservations to Tuscany and they handed us a drink menu and said none of them were included in the price.  They also handed us a QC code for the menu and we did not have phones as we dressed up for a nice night out.  We also had our 3yr old and i could have sworn they said no extra charges at this location...we felt terribly out of place.  We ended up leaving and going to the buffet across the hall instead.  Pool was nice; room was a bit cool and moiste.  There was a wild cat sleeping on the beach chairs so that was entertaining.  We were hoping to go to kids club with our 3yr old so he could play but they wouldnt let us in.  We didnt want to leave him there as he is not potty trained but wete hoping he could paint and play with us supervising but they said no.  Not a great place for people with toddlers.  The beach was lovely so maybe we will return someday when our child is older.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-11-05,10,"I gave this property an overall ""Excellent"" rating.  Most of the staff really goes out of their way to make it an awesome experience.  But; here's a couple of areas for suggested improvement.  First; the wristband policy is somewhat stringent.  On our last night my son's wristband came undone when we were dining inside the resort and he set it on the table.  It went missing and would've cost $100 dollars to replace; so we opted not to have it replaced since it was our last night.  He went out that night with his 2 brothers and when they came back at 2am he was initially not allowed to re-enter the premises(took a lot of persuading).   Second;  hotel staff quoted us a taxi price back to airport that was comparable to Smile & Go (little over $30);  The price was that we were actually charged was twice that; around $60 dollars.   That being said; I would still book again but with more caution.",Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-11-01,10,My family had a great time! The beach and pools were great. The kids like the kids club. The most important was the customer service was great. We had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Gurrola and he really cares about the resort and is trying make sure everyone has an amazing experience. We also loved the Italian restaurant especially Violonist Carlos. He played very nicely and we went almost every night  to hear him play. This was one of the nicest resorts we’ve ever been at.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-10-31,10,Loved it !! We visited during the UK October half term 2 adults 2 kids. Weather was HOT HOT HOT. It showed at 31 but felt like 50!! Pools were clean; hotel was spotless; staff are very friendly and welcoming. Easy Beach access; tidy and staff on hand. Breakfast and Food selection is so yummy and full of variety. We attended a Mexico theme night on a Friday; amazing but must book in advance. My daughter has Coeliac Disease ; the F&B team was very supportive and made a number of options for her. We booked a tour at the hotel; staff explained all was very reassuring and the day was a success!! Spa was slightly pricey; treatment was good. We booked a private transfer separately with Expedia so didn't use the hotel one.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-10-27,6,Instalaciones muy bonitas sobre todo las piscinas; la playa espectacular; el servicio del personal muy bueno.  Lo malo el ambiente pesimo ni ponene musica en las piscinas o instrumental.   La comida no es muy buena es  lo mismo en todos los restaurantes y muy comercial. Las bebidas hay de todo aunque se nota que los cocteles son de empaque  y no los preparan naturales. El entretenimiento en las noches pesimo. Creo que le falta alegria al hotel sin perder la elegancia.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,es

Different options when it comes to food; round the o’clock room service and the view was killer. Everyone was hospitable and welcoming. They have daily activities and they have an Expedia office inside the resort so you can talk to a person one on one and workout a plan directly that can fit your calendar because they can provide more detailed information regarding timing;  excursions types and what to expect.

2022-10-15,6,The property is beautiful but they over charge you for everything. Don’t buy from the on-site travel agent because it will cost you double. The surrounding area is impoverished and full of people who will scam you in a heart beat. Honestly; I’m not sure that the hotels are doing anything for the people who actually live in the surrounding community because you can see the wealth  gap clearly if you drive just 8 minutes down the street. It is troubling to see so many homes without doors. I asked the manager what the hotel does to give back to the community and the response was; “we do what we can”. I was very uncomfortable with this answer because; they charge so much and everything is an up charge; I would feel better about paying more if the hotel at least gave back to their community.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

Our room was always very clean.  All rooms have a great ocean view.  I will return next year.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2022-10-14,10,Wow; this was my first time in Mexico and I took my family with me. The whole resort was beautiful and the staff were all kind and delivered amazing service. The rooms were clean and they even upgraded us to a suite free of charge with a gorgeous view of the ocean. The food (especially the buffet) tasted great and we also tried the Mexican and Italian restaurants for dinner. The shows they provided every night were a fun activity. Funny thing is we didn’t even leave the resort; except for one day to go to Isla Mujeras which was very easy; because the whole place was so nice and filled with activities. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is going for the first time or even people who have been going to Cancun but not this resort.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-10-04,10,I would highly recommend the Grand Fiesta Americana Coral Beach! My husband and I were raving about pretty much everything our entire vacation. The staff is AMAZING. Everyone is SO kind and sincere and professional. I feel like it’s really hard to get exceptional service these days (especially since covid) and the thoughtful; pleasant and prompt service from the front desk; concierge; room service; housekeeping; servers; bar tenders was so refreshing and appreciated. Literally everyone was amazing and consistent. The vibe of the location was romantic and classy but still family friendly with a great variety of drinks and food. The rooms were beachside cozy and very clean! The location was also great and there were a variety of activities you could book right at the hotel. Pay the extra $$$ and get a massage at their spa and book a dinner at the French restaurant! You will not regret it! All in all 10/10 highly recommend.

2022-09-30,4,I traveled to this property for work and have been to many hotels around the world; it was decent as far as the appeal of the lobby and the vibe it offered.  My issue came to the service staff cleaning the room and the front desk staff as well.  I asked for my room not to be cleaned; I had only arrived the night before.  Upon returning to the hotel after a few hours; my door was standing wide open and my makeup bag was been pilfered through; all my brand-new Lancome makeup was gone.  I immediately reported it to the front desk; they didn't seem overly concerned at all merely discounting the trivial loss as if it was a bother to them. It was the principle and the violation that something out of my room was; in fact; stolen; yet there was a complete disregard.  Upon my return to Geneva; I'll find somewhere else to stay to avoid a repeat.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

Plenty of dining options; I do wish the cafe was open earlier for grab and go.  And my only complaint was the pillows.  5 pillows on the bed and not one of them was firm.

2022-09-23,6,Picked this hotel because of the pool. When you log onto the site it’s their opening photo. It looks amazing. What they don’t tell you is hotel guests are pushed to the very back of the pool behind a screen. You can’t even see the pool from there and there is no service. If you want to sit by the pool you need to pay 180 euro. So when we checked in on Monday at 3pm we headed straight to the pool. The entire area around the pool was empty and the area at the back for hotel guests was packed. Made no sense.,Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France,en

2022-09-23,8,Most of the staff are friendly; especially thanks to Samuel.  Every time we saw him; he remembered our names and greeted us cordially.  He arranged beach volleyball for us and had a great time with other travelers.  Hotel facilities are good; the only problem is that there is no exhaust fan in the hotel bathroom.  Food and drinks are great; most would recommend a Mexican formal restaurant but not a sushi restaurant.  Super cool hotel beach and pool; we really enjoyed our time there.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2022-09-22,4,Beach; pools were very nice. Food at resturants was good with perfect portions. Inside buffet was very small and  limited and undesirable compared to other resorts in area. Room service and pool/beach menu was much better! La Joya was very enjoyable! Service was not up to par with other resorts close by. Also noticed staff favored Caucasian people more. (I'm hispanic traveled with husband and 2 teens; and 2 other family members that are Caucasian) the other family members were treated much better and right in front of us!! It was very obvious. Very dissapointed with this. I have been to many resorts in area and have had soo much better treatment and service. Not a fan of this resort. Which is sad because we were so excited to try out this beautiful resort. Shout out to Blanca at the lobby bar who was the only friendly staff we encountered.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-09-20,6,We picked this property based on prior history of great reviews. Having done that this property is far far behind the other fiesta resorts in the area in every aspect. The food was OK; the hotel was outdated; and beach was small. I would recommend Fiesta Americana Condesa over this hotel any day. Also if staying here; the ferry to Isla Mujeres is right next-door would definitely recommend taking that trip to North Beach.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-09-18,6,half of the pool was under construction; beers were never cold; food quality is less than good especially buffet and restaurants are not up to price we paid; and food service and quality are nowhere near 5 star hotel restaurants; our room so as hall way to our room had overwhelming smell of ammonia gave us headache throughout the stay. therefore; we are not going back again.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-09-12,10,The food and drinks are mediocre just like any hotel really. The service though is the best I’ve ever received. They’re extremely helpful and caring. I was helped above and beyond multiple times! My boyfriend lost his two phones in the room after we were already at the airport about to board for our flight. One phone call and not only did the front desk operator quickly tell staff to find the phones; he also had a taxi driver on the spot take the phones to the airport all within 25 min so we wouldn’t miss our flight.

A wonderful vacation destination for quite relaxation. If are looking for fun; excitement; flowing booze and dancing this is not your place. No alcohol service before 11am and not available via room service; only at the restaurants; beach and lobby bar. The music at the pool is limited and pretty low key; we had a violinist performe a few times by the pool- I personally loved that but my teenager was not impressed; she would have preferred some pool or activities and entertainment. Definately a better choice for the over 50 croud.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-08-20,10,I can’t say enough good things.   We thought about Cancun and we thought spring break. This hotel is not the typical drunk fest spring break or hotel; and instead is a quiet peaceful private beach away from the crowds. This is one of our favorite hotels in the entire world to stay at.  It blew away our expectations; and made us want to come back to Cancun; which was very unexpected. We took scuba lessons while at the hotel; and that also exceeded our expectations.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-08-19,10,We loved everything about this resort!!! We tried almost all the restaurants and our favorite was La Basilica; it is worth the $50 extra you have to pay.  All the other restaurants were also excellent.  Their buffet was excellent.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The wait staff on the beach and the pool was excellent; it was like they knew your drink was almost gone and they were there.  The rooms were nice and clean and the turn-down service was excellent.  I would definitely go back to this resort.  We were 4 adults they accommodated with rooms right beside each other and the balcony were right next to each other so we could hang out when we wanted to.  There were some kids around that we didn't care for; but you can upgrade to executive and that area is adults only.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-08-15,10,This resort was the bomb! It was clean; the staff were really nice; the food and dining options were good(especially the vegetarian option); and they offered shows and activities for the family and grown folks. And the resort is right off of the beautiful beach(they keep it clean). I would definitely recommend this resort; especially with the all inclusive(free unlimited) drinks and food and it’s right next to the strip of clubs and bars(like a 3-5 minute walk). I truly enjoyed my stay here with family. Ima definitely come back!,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en
2022-08-15,10,Great hotel. Doesnt look that grand from the front aspect; but dont let that fool you. Staff so hard working and always extremely polite and helpful. Very clean. Swimming pools and balcony views absolutely amazing. Breakfast buffet ideal. Even though 5 *  it wasnt really formal and felt comfortable bringing children. My only criticisms are the games room off the lobby is only open in the evening and can get quite busy. It would be great if kids can use it during the day too when you just want to relax in the hotel. They have a kids club but its age 3-12. My kids didnt want to go and mix with younger ones so the hotel could benefit from more facilties for pre-teens to socialise in. Also the wait for ordering at the pool bar can be quite some time. They are just rushed off their feet and more staff needed in that area. Food wise we tried a few of the restaurants for evening meals; adult choices lovely but there wasnt much option for kids. Stuck to buffet breakfast; cafe grab n go; pool bar and room service most of the time. Lots of places to eat outside in the hotel zone but as its all inclusive you feel you should eat at the hotel. Overall would definitely recommend staying here.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-08-12,8,Overall pleasing environment. The beach is probably the best part of this Resort. The entire resort is extremely clean. Twice a day room service was great. Few in-resort dining options were great like the Mexican Restaurant and the Buffet and some were very disappointing. Some staff were very helpful and welcoming and on the other hand some really didn't care like the girls at the restaurant reservation desk. Not enough entertainment staff around the pools for sports like beach/pool volleyball etc. No night club at the resort. Spa was good. I liked the no-pressure of buying their membership. We will definitely stay there again.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-08-07,10,Overall great place to stay. Amazong beach and pools on site; extremely friendly and helpful staff; on site spa and very good food options. The only downside to this resort is that it is not adults only. Some parents allow there children to do whatever they want including be disrepectful to other guests; particularly in the pool. Not a reflection on the hotel though; just be mindful of this when booking.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-07-13,8,Hotel was great with respect to location to the Cornavin train station. There is a lot of restaurants and shops within walking distance. The hotel concierge gave me a card for free public transportation (you have to ask for it); but the card lets you take any bus; tram; train; etc. for free! The only negative experience with the Warwick Geneva is that the AC is not really good. There's no number indicating the temperature of the room; and it's not clear which way you should actually turn the dial. The room would have been great if I was able to make the room a bit cooler. It's a bit surprising that such a nice hotel has such an antiquated AC unit.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

Beach staff is ok; pool is nice but need repairs; green areas are nice; hotel lobby bar is very quite; no music at pool or beach is allowed; no smoking is allowed but some locals and tourists break the rule;no shows or entertainment available  breakfast is great and you must include for small fee at time to make reservations. Spa is great.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2022-07-05,10,Great resort! I would definitely recommend staying here !,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2022-07-05,10,I have been to this hotel numerous times. The beach is wonderful (no seaweed) and large. Rooms are very nice with comfortable beds. I do not like the bathroom layout (even in club level rooms it is weird) but that has no bearing on my rating. Pools are nice. Beach and pool service is the best ANYWHERE. Martiniano has been taking care of us for 20 plus years and he is very attentive. Breakfast buffet didn't have much I liked (fussy) so we only ate there once and walked to VIPS the other mornings. Lunch at the beach/pool is fantastic. Fajitas; chicken wings and burgers are all excellent. Did not eat there at night as there are so many wonderful restaurants nearby. Service at night at the bar right on the beach is great. I have stayed at most hotels in Cancun and the Presidente is my favorite. You cannot go wrong choosing this hotel.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-07-03,10,Our stay at the Intercontinental Presidente was phenomenal. The beach area around the property is beautiful. The food and service was great. We had a classic king room with an outside area. The room was always cleaned to perfection and fhe room was always cold. They have 2 pools and 5 hot tubs on top of dozens of cabanas with laying chairs. Never had a hard time finding one. The drinks were great. It's walking distance to many nearby restaurants. You can easily get on the bus to go other places. The restaurant inside the hotel even has tables on the beach and we had a romantic dinner on the beach on our last night. Don't second guess yourself and just book it. You won't regret it. Cannot wait to return!,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

Room was very clean; but could have done with updating; as curtains; carpet etc. look a bit old.

2022-07-02,10,Nice property with excellent service; beautiful beach; and great swimming pool. The beach did not have seaweed and the water was very clear. The ratio of beach area to number of guests is lower than other resorts; avoiding an over crowded beach. This is an old hotel that was nicely renovated. The food was okay. Better than all inclusive resorts but not at the level of good restaurants. The hotel restaurants are expensive but convenient. Hotel staff are wonderful.

Can hear ppl talking from the hall way. 2 nights straight around 1 am; we were terrified about the fight/argument from a room next to ours. A Hispanic woman’s was yelling and screaming.

I was disappointed at the quality of food from room service - ordered a steak sandwich but the steak tasted like rubber; not real steak; also very expensive. Food in general I found very expensive - not reasonable with the quality being served. Additionally what sold me on the property was the jacuzzi - only to find out it was additional cost.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-06-16,8,My mom and I stayed at this hotel as part of our French Riviera road trip in June 2022. The property was lovely; and the staff were attentive; as expected by a Fairmont. However; a few items worth noting: Firstly; two large new buildings are being built in-front of the hotel on the water-side; which means both loud construction noises continuously and also views of the water are partially obstructed by construction. Secondly; the pool at the hotel is part of the Nikki Beach Club. If you want a spot anywhere near the pool you have to pay for beds and bottle fees; if you are a hotel guest you a free lounger crowded together in an area where you cannot see the pool and near the construction so it is all you can hear; this also gets very very busy on the weekends and you may not get into the pool if not booked in advance. When we were there; the hotel was doing a promo shoot by the pool and pulled one of the free loungers by the pool to look like that’s where guests are situated but it’s untrue and deceptive marketing. Lastly; the hotel is also not on the beach as pictured. However; there is a private shuttle to and from the private beach and the concierge and Fairmont beach staff accompany you the entire time during transportation so this was actually a wonderful experience for us. It’s also worth stating that the entrance to the hotel is right on the corner of the  famous hairpin turn so it’s always busy and not easy for in and out driving your own car but the valet help!,Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France,en

2022-06-14,10,Surprised to say the least! I came here to celebrate my birthday and this hotel went above and beyond. Let me start by saying; I had a surprised birthday cake waiting for me in my room when I came back from my excursion. Almost all of the staff wore mask even in the heat; outside and on the beach. The ribeye was good at restaurant - Urbano and the outside pool bar. The drinks was well made and can we talk about how great the sauna; steam room and massage by Lenny was. Everything was amazing including the nurse who completed my covid test on-site. This hotel has 2 large pools; 5 mini pool pods as I call them; 4-5 places to eat from; spa and etc. Bell man was great with identifying your transportation when they picked you up. My bill was correct with charges to my room; my bed was comfy and rooms very spacious. The hotel is gorgeous at night. Lifeguards for the beach area. Staff remember my name throughout my day!!! This hotel is less than 30 minutes from the airport and 15 minute walk from Coco Bongo party district. Pharmacy and mini store is less than 5 minutes walk across the hotel. You would have to leave the hotel if you choose to stay here and relax. Playa de Carmen was about an hour ride.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-05-20,10,I traveled solo and asked for a king size bed with a terrace. The room was spacious and clean. The resort grounds are very beautiful and well-maintained. While there was a slight delay at check-in I was able to get some work done in the business center while I waited. Servers at the free breakfast each morning are attentive and efficient. There’s an omelette station lots of fruit in each morning is a different Mexican dish. The chicken with moly sauce was excellent! The property is at the end of the entertainment strip leading to a quiet exclusive beachfront property. Security patrol all night keeping us safe. The property is also right across the street from a 24 hour gas station that has a subway and there’s some restaurants at all on that block they have a variety of food from Mexican to Italian is pizza right there. So if you are like me looking for a resort that has free breakfast and then other dining options and drink options it’s all right there for you. The exit Covid testing is only $20 cash or charge. The results returned within 30 minutes and you can get a print out if you requested. Plus they’ll send you emails with your documentation as well. The refrigerator in the room has enough space for you to fit a 2 L bottle in it standing up. So there’s plenty of space there for you to have your other food if you need it. I would definitely stay here again the price was reasonable. And the accommodations were comfortable clean and beautiful. The staff was very friendly.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-05-14,8,The hotel is well run and the common areas are delightful. The big problem with the hotel is the terrible and overwhelming smell of mold in the hallways and rooms. If you have a sensitivity to mold you must avoid this hotel bc it will make you sick. It is too bad that the management is as shortsighted as to keep the mold this intensely unpleasant. I only stayed one night in transit; but I would have to book something else if I was here for a week. The rooms are okay but not fancy.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-05-12,8,The property is exceptional absolutely beautiful and the staff are outstanding. All very pleasant and professional. GEM Spa is worth a visit - on par with Four Seasons easily. Now for the not so good review. For the $$ I spent at this resort I wasn't blown away by the food. This is not a review on the servers because they were amazing and all deserve recognition for how good they are. Vina Del Mar for breakfast and a dinner buffet (AWESOME). Isla Contoy - the view is great; staff is great that's about it.  Tuscany for Italian - great. La Joya -  just blah. Le Basilic - AMAZING worth every penny extra to go. Nah K'aax worth it for the beach vibe for sure. Food was fine.  Drinks are plentiful anywhere you go. WINE? 2 choices of red and both are bad - I would have gladly paid extra for a better glass. So that's the bad part of my review but other than that this is a stunning resort and worth a visit.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and can't speak enough on how fantastic this hotel is.I will only ask that they look into the policy of parents not getting visibility to the kids club. I didn't feel comfortable dropping my kids without getting a tour of the place or seeing the activities my kids will partake in.

It is in a great location that allows you to visit the ""downtown"" area within a walking distance or take a taxi. The back of the hotel was by far my favorite. Very clean and friendly staff. Also; the best view of the ocean with plenty of activities.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2022-04-20,8,Läget mycket bra om man reser med tåg då hotellet finns precis mittemot tågstationen. Rummet var rent men skulle behövas uppdateras och renoveras. Inredningen är gammaldags och det var t.ex. svårt att hitta uttag för att ladda mobilen.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,sv

2022-04-16,10,We had a great experience. All of the staff were super friendly and helpful. Beautiful property; great beach; excellent pools. Regarding food/restaurants; we had an awesome dinner our last night there at La Joya restaurant which was our favorite. The buffet for breakfast never wowed. We never went for lunch or dinner. The Tuscany Italian restaurant was great. And I forget the name of the seafood restaurant located outside near the pools but our one lunch experience there was good as well. Besides La Joya; which was very good; all of the other food offerings were good but not great. And we didn’t go to the French restaurant because it was an adults only location and we didn’t want split from our kids. But all in all; 5 stars out of 5 is what I would give Grand Fiesta Americana Coral Beach. We totally recommend it and would go there again.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-04-14,10,Gorgeous property! I was Skeptical because of the other reviews but this was by far my favorite all inclusive resort so far. My husband and I took our 7 and 9 year olds. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. The room was cleaned twice a day and the view from the balcony was unbelievable. The food in every restaurant was delicious. The night entertainment was different and fun every night. There wasn’t much entertainment during the day but the violinist and cello player by the pool was different and beautiful. Definitely a five star resort!,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-04-12,10,I was there with my family and it was an amazing experience for all of us. It was so good that We wanted to extend our stay there but we couldn’t.

2022-04-08,8,I have been so many resorts in the Caribbean but I’ve never experienced service that this hotel provided which is beyond my words. The rooms are outdated and could use some updating. The ONLY complain I would have is the food. There is no food variety at all. I have not eaten steak or chicken in 5 days so we went to a steakhouse and paid across the street. If you love food this is not the place for you; however the food that they actually serve it tastes good. Also they do not have any kids entertainment during the day at all like other resorts.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-04-08,8,Our stay was really good. When we first arrived; the check in process was slower than you would expect but when we got to the front the service was good. Our room overlooked the parking lot; which was fine I guess as we didn’t select a more expensive room; but needed to use ear plugs to drown out traffic on street noise. The room was good; but it had a damp smell and also the bathroom fan did not work. I asked the front desk about it and someone came up and put febreze or something in the room and it smelled better. We also opened the window to air it out; and the next day the room smelled good. Very comfortable beds and nice sheets. Nice big shower with lots of hot water. The outside resort area looked like the photos - was stunning. And the beach was great and they kept it relatively clean of sargassum. The beach was wonderful. We went for a walk down the beach and looking at other resorts; we were relieved with our decision as our beach area was so much nicer. They kept the chairs a little social distanced; while the others were packed like sardines. We wished the hotel enforced the no smoking policy. The food at the hotel restaurants did not have good selections especially for plant based people - not even one choice. So we had to leave the resort to eat. Chedauri supermarket food court on the 3rd floor - get yourself a great bottle of wine from the floor (amazing selection) and then order your food and sit outside with your wine! Casa Tequila was also good.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-03-31,10,Highly recommend the Fiesta Americana Grand Coral Beach. Transportation was arranged and was fantastic. Friendly staff; in all areas of the hotel and highly attentive.  We were upgraded to a beautiful; huge room; that was clean; comfortable and nicely appointed. Gorgeous view from our 10th floor balcony. The beach is so nice; clean and swimmable due to being near the point which is protected from the high surf. Each restaurant we ate at was pretty good.  My favorite was the tacos; sopas and quesadillas from the pool side bar and my son loved the ice cream; burgers and french toast. The staff was very attentive on the beach and at the pool; always bringing drinks and food. There was a security guard that was present near the beach/pool and gave me sense of comfort. The jet ski rental was fun as well as the SUP; and the staff was great there too. We watched 2 night shows at the pool which were entertaining. Neat location at the end of the hotel zone; close to Copa Cabana; which was crazy busy.  The hotel is clean and modern; beds were comfy; and the A/C worked great. Room service was also awesome; good burgers and quick. Will return.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-03-31,8,What I liked was the Staff and Cleanliness of Resort. Pool area Large and ample room for adults; kids and Business groups. Great service always outstanding. Food and options are limited and OK. although I didn't go Hungry. Did upgrade status to a VIP level; that is where I feel it falls short. Really wasn't worth the upgrade. VIP or Elite Club is not really located on convenient Floor or location close to rooms. Like most Concierge's levels are on same floor. Elite Outdoor Bar & Lounge is not close to pool area. Upgrade Liquor is only at those two Bar areas and not in Restaurants; which was told we were able to get access to higher level wine choices and Premium Liquor. Not the case. Paid for bottle of wine.  Very Nice Experience and would recommend for families for sure. Not a Foodie place but Staff is amazingly accommodating and you feel you are there #1 Priority. Covid19 you are covered! This is the place for you if you have any concerns. Spa which was not aware of when booking was amazing! That is a experiance in its self. Highly Recommend a visit for sure.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

This is not some cookie cutter impersonal all inclusive like so many in the area; this is a luxury hotel that has a wonderful staff that treat every guest with kindness and true hospitality.

2022-03-23,2,Not a 5 star hotel; when I looked at the prices at Expedia; this hotel is more expensive than Hyatt Ziva; which is right beside this hotel so we decided on this one because we want to stay in a nicer 5 star hotel and we don't mind paying more but unfortunely we did not get what we paid for. Website advertised free hotel transfer but it's false; we paid $70usd each trip which is fine as long we got a private car. But on the 2nd last day we wanted to request another private car to the airport; we were told to just take the taxi; and we had to argue with the conceirge to get them to arrange a car for us. There is no car rental; no currency exchange; no exchange from big bills to smaller bills; poor management. We told some restaurants were adults only and at the end we see kids entering the adult only restaurants; and we went with our son and we were not allow to enter and when we questioned them; they told us there is an exemption; when we ask what is the exemption; there was no answer. All restaurants even the buffet did not allow sleeveless and my husband had to change; then we saw a few people entering the restaurant sleeveless. So what is that about? Double standard. Hotel room is extremely old and bad wifi. Only good thing are extremely hard working pool staff; wait staff; and cleaning staff; and room service. The management and check in staff is total garage. We didn't even feel safe putting my son to the kids club most of the days because it's closed off,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-03-22,10,Pretty old building it seems; but very well maintained and very clean. If it gets full to the capacity (which happened during our March-break stay); it gets pretty busy and hard to get a spot under a shade; although staff is doing great job trying to please customers. Beach is great; almost no seaweed at least during our stay. Pools are amazing too. Food is good and plenty; buffet does not have too many options though; best to book all restaurants and that way have variety during dinner time.

2022-03-21,10,This has been our favorite hotel in Cancun for many; many years. Unfortunately due to the pandemic and some changes in the way the hotel does business; it has gone downhill somewhat. One of the things we did not like at all is that is has gone all-inclusive. That diminishes the quality of the food served in the restaurants. Also; service in the pool area could have been better. Staff was attentive once you got their attention; but there simply weren't enough of them to attend to all the guests around the pool. The hotel; however; is very conveniently located and the beach is great because it doesn't have as much current as the other hotels further down the coast have.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-03-20,4,Well where do I begin … when we arrived at the hotel the check in process was very unpleasant. The guy attending us seemed to be in a bad mood . Other stays I’ve enjoyed over the years the check in process was smooth and great . The sales pitch right after we received our room keys was annoying and the guy was not taking no for an answer til we were firm with him . Things were going great til they tried kicking me out of the room a day early . I had booked a two bedroom suite which was very misleading since it’s just a connecting room with a door in the middle. They tried kicking me out one of the conjoined rooms and I had to go argue with the front desk which was time consuming and distasteful since they came into our room twice without asking and or knocking and my young daughter was there alone which I didn’t like . How ever it gets worse. We had a group of our friends come with us which we’re staying in another two rooms on a separate floor and towards the end of the night they would hang out on the balcony having drinks in on of the rooms . Well to their surprise on one of the nights while being on the balcony a man that was hotel staff was on my friends balcony since he figured no one was there ! No privacy man . How many people have access to the room other than the room cleaning people ?! I’ve been to Cancun enough times and I can honestly say I did not feel safe in this hotel what do ever . Very disappointed to the degree if they gave me a week free here I’d deny it.,Grand Fiesta Americana,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-03-05,8,Optamos pelo Intercontinental por ser uma rede internacional; não tivemos grandes problemas em relação ao hotel; o problema foi que os hóspedes guardavam as cadeiras e guarda sol da praia com toalhas; então quando você chegava para pegar uma prainha; não haviam mais cadeiras e guarda-sol; os bangalôs são pagos a parte. O erro do hotel é não ter cadeiras e guarda sol suficiente para todos os hóspedes na praia. Bem localizado e praia boa. O nosso quarto tinha um pouco de cheiro de umidade.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,pt

2022-02-24,10,The moment you enter the lobby you are greeted by amazingly friendly and professional staff.  They have a fantastic fragrance in both the lobby and the elevators that makes me smile.  Front desk people were helpful but Greg in Concierge was as good as they come.  He spent time on locating a pharmacy; airport transfers; restaurants ; Carnaval tickets; train schedules and more and never seemed in a hurry despite always being busy.  I didn't eat at the restaurant but there were always patrons and especially on Valentine's Day when they put out extra tables and they were all filled.  Something must have been great.  Lucille was very helpful and kind in the bar.  She took extra time to help me with my French.  The location is so nice with being just across from the Promenade des Anglais.  Oh; the rooms were very nice and very clean.,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France,en

The hotel is located in a great area that offers an amazing beach access just a short walk from your room. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. We had dinner and breakfast at the main restaurant and the staff always went above and beyond to make us feel great. Our waiters Gustavo and David were amazing. They greeted us every day as if they we’re truly happy to see us. They even sang my wife happy birthday and brought us a complimentary dessert.

2022-01-04,6,What I dislike the most was THIS IS NOT AN ALL INCLUSIVE PROPERTY. Not sure why they’re even using the term all inclusive when the only thing that was included was breakfast. That is absolutely misleading. We only stayed three nights so it wasn’t a big deal but had we stayed longer we would’ve been extremely disappointed. The pool and beach area was beautiful - plenty of covered chairs to relax. The three whirl pools; while looked nice were not hot tubs which is totally useless to me. There was no entertainment on the property which was also disappointing. “Luz” the concierge young lady who’s name I’m probably misspelling was extremely nice and very helpful in helping us find some entertainment and other things; including scheduling our in room Covid test. she explained that the hotel is more of a business property so that may be my fault for not doing extensive research about the entertainment. The view from our room was gorgeous. The room could use a little updating as we can see scratches on the furniture and other size of old age but all in all for three nights it was fine. We also could only find two English-speaking channels on the television but again for three nights it wasn’t a big deal,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2022-01-02,4,For a USD$856 hotel room; I expected better. Perhaps something clean with nice room service? I am not a picky traveler; but the room was so tired that I questioned whether I had teleported. Stains everywhere. The breakfast was disappointing as well; so no; not worth it by a long shot. The only thing that saved this hotel for me was the nice beach; so if you'll be spending most of your time there; I suppose it could work out well. I stayed one night before I moved to another place. It was peak season so very few places were available; but I found a USD$63/night bed and breakfast with a better looking room where I spent the rest of my vacation.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2021-12-21,10,Hotellet ligger precis på stranden och kanske den bästa delen av stranden på denna sidan udden. Vi hade tillgång till lounge som var öppen mellan 18.00-20.00; helt ok utbud vad gäller dricka och mindre smårätter. Dock var servicen i loungen inte särskilt bra; massvis med tomma glas och tallrikar som stod överallt; trots att det var lite folk i loungen. Frukosten intogs i loungen; också helt ok utbud. Bra städning av rum. Knappt 10 minuters gångväg till downtown hotelarea där ett antal restauranger finns. Inget negativt föruton lite slapp service i barer och lounge; där mobiltelefonen verkar vara det viktigaste.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,sv

2021-12-12,8,"This property is beautiful. The only downside was the restaurants and bars. When we asked two ladies at the front desk where we could have dinner they pointed us to the beach restaurant but never mentioned there was a second restaurant open and also a nice bar. I figured it out by myself later in the evening and confirmed it with the waiter that said two restaurants were open plus the bar. It's a shame as we had already eaten at the beach restaurant that same day and would have been happy to experience something else. Same for breakfast the next day; confusion on where we could go. The hotel lacks ""life"" in their f&b outlets. Apart from this great hotel with great location.",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

The caribeño and cafe urbano. At the caribeño is where the breakfast buffet is offer i had a very romantic diner with my girlfriend at the beach with a bottle of moet ;food for $150 overall good restaurant great service and the prices are not as bad typical to all prices at cancun that by the way is a very ""expensive"" place to visit. Cafe urbano had breakfast twice at my stay also not bad at all will recomended with $23 or less you will have a decent breakfast.

2021-11-01,8,I had booked a room with double beds and we were given a room with a king size bed. Dont know why youre never given what you pay for. Happened also at an all inclusive hotel that we booked together with this one. Staff was very friendly. Isaak at front desk helped us get our double bed room bad thing was it was without a view. Anyways we chose this hotel because we were not going to be spending much time here. These days we were going to do all our running around & sight seeing. So we really just needed a bed to sleep.

There could have been a kinder way to handle it I thought. Other then that I enjoyed the facilities. Small but solid fitness room and indoor pool. I would stay there again and just get my breakfast else where. Oh and be sure you look at the “partial Sea view” before they talk you into upgrading for 50 or 60 euros a night.

2021-09-18,2,"I'm horrified by my 1 night stay! The check in process; which took 45+ min.; was a disaster! Staff was not properly trained. I was initially given the wrong room. So I had to go complain and was eventually given the room I paid for. That was a 1.5-hour waste of time! Once I finally got settled; I took a lap around the hotel. Overall; I was not impressed with the cleaning-less of the place; carpets smelled and looked dirt; pool was cloudy and gross looking; windows were dirty and not cleaned; shower was moldy and growing; beach was a mess and was the nastiest thing I've even seen! Smelled like a rotten whale from the seaweed and dirt on the sand. Looked like it had not been cleaned in days. But that was nothing compared to what I found later! After dinner; I decided to use the restroom in my room. What I found was the most disgusting/unacceptable thing I have ever encountered! There was a wipe of human feces on the wall next to the toilet! THATS RIGTH! HUMAN POOP! From the previous guests! See attached pictures. I immediately went to front desk and showed pictures. I was met with no sympathy and was offered to have a housekeeper come and wipe it off; which should have been done while the room was cleaned and not after guests are checked in! This is extra disturbing during a pandemic; which cleaning is ""supposed"" to be enhanced! I checked out the next morning and have not yet been given a refund for my second night. Avoid this place like the plague!",InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2021-09-15,8,The building itself is gorgeous in a FANTASTIC location.  There were TONS of restaurants in a five minute walk…10 minute walk to old town and across the street from the Mediterranean Sea!  For 5 star…the rooms were a rather normal hotel rooms…nothing spectacular but were nice.  The bed was fine and I am a bed snob.  The separate toilet and bathroom was nice.  I also liked the separate shower and tub.  We were perplexed that there were not black out curtains to later to find there were blackout shutters externally on the windows.  They were electric and very easy to use.  The only negative thing to say is about the toiletries provided.  These are small things but the soaps and shampoos were mediocre.  Not a big deal at all.  I am not sure if this is a Nice thing or not but they toilet paper provided was downright painful.  I mean like a torture chamber terrible.  I will know this next time…Cotonelle will be traveling internationally.  If that’s the only negative…we are doing great!  I had a spectacular time!,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France,en
2021-09-15,6,The property was quiet. A unique feature that I enjoyed. The music was at a minimum and not offensive. The beach had a smell of dead fish that the staff attributed to the hurricanes.

2021-08-27,4,Stayed 6 days during the week Hurricane Grace made landfall in the Yucatan peninsula. Fortunately; it was just a Category 1 storm when it reached Cancun on Wednesday night and was gone by early Thursday afternoon.  I have traveled extensively: By international standards this is NOT a 4-star hotel. I agree with some reviewers that this hotel is outdated and the rooms; though clean; need remodeling. For instance; there were some cracked and broken tiles in the shower and the tub was chipped in two places.  Yet on its website the Presidente Intercontinental Cancun Resort shows a picture bearing the caption NEWLY RENOVATED (sic). Moreover; the picture is deceiving because the areas to the right and left of the hotel are now densely developed:  How old is that picture? As for dining; guests can choose among El Caribeno; buffet breakfast; lunch and dinner; Le Cap Beach Club; casual dining; Café Urbano; breakfast a la carte and go-and-grab items. Generally speaking; the food quality was average; and food and drinks were overpriced. In contrast; restaurant Urbano offers a more varied menu and better food quality. It opened exceptionally for dinner on the evening of the hurricane; and for breakfast and lunch on the following day. The rest of the time access is reserved for IHG Rewards members. A word about El Caribeno: This is an open dining area with a palm-thatched roof. It is dark and old. The first morning I was there I looked up and saw the beams that support the palm-thatched,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2021-08-26,6,Drugs in the hotel! Be aware! Overall; we liked the location. But; when operating the air conditioner in the room;  a cloud of drug fumes entered our room from one of the adjacent rooms. We immediately called the reception; and nothing was done. In the following morning; we complained; they said they know of this problem; but didn't even offer an apology. I am very upset. At the least; they should have reimbursed the couple of nights when this problem happened.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

Rommene mangler teknisk oppgradering. Vårt rom hadde god utsikt mot havet med terrasse. Svømmebassenget styres av Nikki Beach som gjør det vanskelig å finne solsenger og gir liten tilgjengelighet hvis du ikke har lyst til å betale 30 Euro per seng.

2021-08-15,8,Our stay was great! Only 3 things to help improve: 1) the food option was poor and prices were excessively high for what you pay. 2) on the eco-friendly part; please stop putting plastic bottles of water and for shampoo/conditioner. 3) the taxi service is a total ripoff. 15$ for a 10 min trip where for locals the price is 6$. The hotel should make an effort to have a deal with the taxis to charge a reasonable price for hotel guests.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2021-08-14,2,Plenty of food and drinks; but that's not included. You have to pay for water; $6.00 a bottle; said i had to pay cash because i had no credit card on file.( I paid for the 4 nights in cash and gave them my credit card for incidentals. Incidentals for this place i really don't know what they are; but after paying with cash in the beginning; I should have gotten a receipt. When i went to check out; there were $1100 extra charges on the card. I paid 2x for crap food room service on the card wich was around $80 the rest of any food or drinks were paid with cash. This place is NOT a resort;  its an over priced hotel with everyone asking for a tip. I have been in so many places in Cancun and riviera maya and NEVER had to do anything except for enjoy the day and night. No nightly shows; and it's 20 dollars to taxi to Senior Frog's and the other bars which was only a couple blocks away. They expected tips also; but that was ok by me. I had 1 lunch at the outside restaurant and it was...different. Not bad; I just never ate octopus salad. I think it was around $16 dollars a plate average. Then the last part is the worst. Checking out. She only spoke Spanish and I only know a little Spanish; so trying to read a receipt in Spanish and getting an answer in Spanish was pretty much impossible. No manager around to explain. And they didn't post the cash payment on it. They took the room off the credit card and said nothing about the cash paid upon check in.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2021-08-14,10,Our 15-night stay at the hotel was great. Excellent staff and facilities. Very nice beach front area. Gym could use better air conditioning (typically 26.5C and humid in the studio).

2021-08-12,10,Great hotel very clean and comfy! Pool area  and beach are gorgeous! The prices for food and drink are very pricey; bordering on too much. Breakfast was expensive and very disappointing; comparable to many free breakfast buffet I’ve had in other places. For 500 pesos per person just not worth it. Dinner was amazing! Well worth the price! High quality; great wine selection and service by the beach. Overall this is an excellent hotel.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2021-08-12,10,Todo muy bien 👍  lo único es que no varían el desayuno bufete. En general una estancia muy agradable y para mi la mejor playa que hay; muy limpia. Gracias,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,es
2021-08-12,10,Our stay at the InterContinental Presidente  Cancun was great. The room was clean;fresh; and large.  The bathroom was also great.  The hotel was an awesome place to stay if you want to relax by the pool or the bar.  Get a drink and go out to the white sand beaches.  The people at the hotel were accommodating and helpful with the Covid restrictions before coming home...,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2021-08-10,10,While only a short stay; I appreciate the location; the service and the whole package. However; a minus for the breakfast. I felt it was low quality for the label.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2021-08-10,4,It was a very disappointing stay at this hotel; we paid in advanced for some excursions and the person in charge at the hotel completely messed up our reservations and caused us a day of our trip we had everyday planned. Our wait time for our breakfast was over one hour and a half ! Our toilet kept getting clogged up; we would get woken up early many times to supposedly fix our television that we never called to get fixed; we spoke to the manager Torrez and she offered us credit that till this day we have not received!! Overall our stay here was very disappointing; we have stayed in other nearby hotels and decided to give this one a chance but after this stay we will not go back.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2021-08-04,2,I am very disappointed with the hotel. I have stayed at this hotel before and I have noticed that it becomes worse and worse each time. I checked in with my daughter and after begging to be placed in a room with two beds; I was placed in a room with no air conditioning. The temperature at that time in Cancun was more than 90 degrees. The room was an oven. Of course; they tried to fix the air conditioning but what was very disappointing is that the hotel had plenty of other rooms. The rooms need upgrading; the bedding and furniture need to be replaced. There are no enough lounge chairs either. I am not staying here ever again. There are many other hotels.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en
2021-08-04,10,This hotel was nothing short of amazing.  The best views; the best location; and the best staff.  It’s clean; conveniently located to other restaurants on the strip; although we ate at the restaurants on site and each was so good there’s really no reason to leave. Ohhh the views.  The beach was free of seaweed; amazingly clean and plenty of space; it wasn’t crowded at all.  Stay here; you will not regret it.  Did I mention how comfortable the beds were.  Yes save yourself trouble and stay here.  It’s really perfect.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2021-08-02,10,Presidente Intercontinental was a great experience.  Everything was enjoyable.  The food was not their top quality but with so many restaurants near by; this is not a problem. However;  the beach food was perfect for our relaxing days on the sand. I had an injured food and this hotel is well equiped with ramps and elevators to accommodate anyone with physical disabilities. Something other more fancy and more expensive hotels did not offer. The staff at Presidente were great; helpful; polite; and so sweet. We had a horrible experience staying at Xcaret Mexico for the first five nights of our vacation but Presidente Intercontinental saved our vacation from b3ing a complete disaster.  You made us feel like we want to give Cancun a second chance. Thank you everyone at Presidente.,InterContinental Presidente,Cancun,Mexico,en

2021-08-01,2,En arrivant à l'hôtel; les voituriers sont restés à l'intérieur de l'hôtel en train de discuter; nous avons pris nos bagages nous mêmes; en rentrant à l'hôtel ils nous ont demandés si nous avions besoins d'aides! A la réception; on a informé que notre chambre n'était pas prête (16:00); supplément pour notre chien (boston terrier) 50€/nuit pour le pack chien. En arrivant à la chambre nous avons compris pour quoi elle n'était pas prête; on nous a donné une vieille chambre dans laquelle il y avait une odeur insupportable; j'imagine à cause de notre chien; ce n'tait pas à cause du remplissage de l'hôtel ''complet'' car une grande partie des chambres étaient vides. Une vieille lentille de contact sur la table de nuit; un permis de conduire dans le coffre d'un précédent client et le clou; le réveille qui sonne à 6h du matin; programmé par un ancien occupant. Nous avons été dans beaucoup de 5* dans notre vie; mais celui-ci était le summum des choses ratés. Nous n'irons plus jamais dans cet hôtel.,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France,fr

2021-07-24,8,Hotel is nice and well located in Monte Carlo. Well equipped and comfortable rooms; though perhaps a little dated. Nobu restaurant is definitely worth a visit; but not so much the others on site. Service from staff is generally reserved for those turning up in a Ferrari and staying in a high end suite; midrange customers can feel somewhat overlooked. The hotel is maybe better suited to the “see and been seen” crowd than those looking for a relaxing break with good restaurants and beaches on the Côte d’Azur; but maybe that can be said for Monaco in general. The Fairmont can be a reasonable base for a stay in Monaco.,Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France,en

2019-07-11,8,It was a joy to stay at this iconic hotel - hard to beat being right by the ocean; the casino; and the famous hairpin turn! Location aside; the property oozes luxury; from the moment you walk in you can tell it’s a 5 star stay. Every member of the staff was super friendly and professional and really gave us the celebrity treatment; which definitely made a difference. The pool and restaurants were amazing; and the room was gorgeous. The only negative from the stay is that there is significant construction going on near the water on the east side (some Marina Extension project or something). We had splurged on a sea view room and unfortunately ~70% of the view has construction in it (which was also noisy during the day); so that was a pretty big disappointment especially after paying so much for the view; which would have been absolutely stunning otherwise (although still was nice). The construction can also be seen from the restaurants and pool on the 7th floor. This is nothing the hotel can really control so nothing against it but just a word for the other travelers who get the sea view room - you will see cranes and barges!,Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France,en

2019-05-10,6,Bei der Anreise mit dem Auto verpaßt man leicht die kleine Auffahrt und befindet sich dann auf der Taxispur. Der vom Hotel angebotene Parkservice für 30€ am Tag funktioniert leider nur etwas schleppend; d.h. man wartet meistens etwas zulange auf seinen Wagen. Das Hotel selbst ist nicht sehr attraktiv. Durch die Erhaltung der alten Fassade ist der Meerblick extrem eingeschränkt und der Blick auf die anderen Hotelzimmer wirkt grau und unfreundlich. Die Balkone sind ungemütlich; grau und  haben eine schmutzig wirkende Umrandung; die Bestuhlung ist sehr einfach. Die Zimmer selbst sind ok; aber nicht besser als 4 Sterne. Das Zimmer war sauber; aber es hat schon ein paar Jahre hinter sich; eine Renovierung wäre angesagt. Das Verdunkelungs-Rollo funktioniert elektrisch; aber zwischen den Lamellen blieb stellenweise Platz; was am Morgen durch gleissende weise Lichtblitze das Schlafvergnügen störte; da der Vorhang nicht zum Zuziehen geht. Das Bett war von guter Qualität. Das Badezimmer hat eine Badewanne und eine Dusche; die einem 4 und nicht einem 5 Sterne Hotel entspricht. Auch das Personal entspricht einem 4 Sterne Hotel und keinesfalls 5 Sterne.,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France,de

2018-09-25,10,Beautiful hotel in a great location. We were able to check in early; were given an upgrade to a sea front room and on returning to our room one evening cound we had been left some delicious cake in celebration of our wedding anninversary.,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France,en

2018-09-22,10,This is THE place to stay at in Cannes for many reasons. Let's start with the fact that it's one of the most beautiful and luxurious hotels you will see. Moreover; it has best location in Cannes. Train station (5 mins) if you want to visit Monaco; port (10 mins) for a trip to St. Tropez; all the fancy shops right at hotel's entrance. There is a private beach with a good restaurant; amazing pool with bar and food and great service.,barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France,en
2018-09-22,8,Great stay in an amazing location.  Just wish there was more of a heads up on all the coastal drilling; construction going on.  Paid for more for the ocean view upgrade and chose the hotel for that reason. Unpleasantly surprised to have off shore drilling all night and bright lights fr the cranes.  Hotel manger was nice enough to include a complementary breakfast buffet which was nice.  I just didn’t get the experience we had hoped for with an ocean view in Monte Carlo.,Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France,en
2018-09-22,2,O Hotel é bem localizado. Quartos são bons. Mas para mim pecam forte em pequenos detalhes. Vou citar três situações que vivenciei em apenas uma diária: a) cheguei no hotel as 13 horas e pedi se podia fazer check in. Embora houvesse quarto disponível o atendente falou que somente seria possível após as 15 horas ou eu deveria pagar uma taxa. Ressalto que é uma prática bem comum em hoteis deixar fazer check in antes se o quarto esta disponível. Na mesma viagem parei em outros dois hoteis muito bons (Chateau De La Chevre D Or - Eze e Negresco; Nice) e em ambos os casos foi possível. b) solicitei um quarto silencioso pois estava com  bebe de seis meses com dificuldades para dormir. Acontece que me colocaram em um quarto que fica um andar abaixo do lobby; e havia uma festa naquela noite. O barulho de batidas de salto no teto somente parou as 1 AM. c) fomas para a piscina as 10:30 AM. Quase não haviam hospedes na piscina. Acontece que mesmo assim as únicas poltronas que eu poderia sentar eram bem distantes da piscina e sem sombra (horríveis para quem esta com um bebê). As poltronas envolta da piscina eram pagas. As seguintes ja estavam todas reservadas. Enfim; embora fosse a piscina do hotel os hóspedes só podem a utilizar plenamente pagando taxas; ou solicitando reserva prévia de cadeiras. Completo absurdo. Obviamente não é uma experiência que será repetida.,Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France,pt

2018-09-21,10,Dette hotellet lever opp til sine 5 stjerner. Tross i at vi første natten fikk et lite hjørnerom; fikk vi dagen etter byttet til et større rom uten noen som helst sure miner.

2018-09-15,6,We booked a sea view room; on arrival we went to our room on the sixth floor to find looking out from our room a four meter concrete wall blocking the sea view; we were told this was a sea view room as we could partially see the sea; but thery would move us the next day to the nith floor that has a full sea view; after the move every night we were woken up by some electrical motor / pump staring up in to the early hours of the morning; as was not a cheep hotel by far I would not expect this from a 5 Star Hotel bit we did not want to move room yet again; I did not receive any value for money from this hotel.,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France,en

2018-09-14,10,Fabulous stay.  The operation of the hotel is superlative; amenities in great shape; service impeccable. If there is one star that doesn’t shine as brightly; it would be the unsyncopated attention in the dining room. The wait staff makes itself; hmmmm; I shall say “unobtrusive” but that’s not convenient when there’s a tour to catch. But don’t misunderstand: The food is excellent and when tending to one’s table; the staff is finessed. Definitely would stay at the Hyatt again for both  the hotel itself and its location.,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France,en

2018-09-05,8,It was good but not great! No dark curtain in the room so we had to put up with the lights at night & the daylight in the morning. We did not get much sleep & it was a pitty because the beds were so very comfortable. Beds were amazing! All the staff was excellent! Very good service. Shower was also reallybad. Water flow extremely weak & temperature impossible to adjust. Location is fabulous!,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France,en
2018-09-04,6,We were excited to stay here especially since it’s supposed to be a nice hotel chain. It was also part of our honeymoon and the hotel we splurged the most on. Overall; we were disappointed with the hotel for the price. The rooms or at least our room we found to be pretty outdated. The furnishings look old and the bathroom looks the same. I’ve stayed at many other hotels that are also 4 Star that are much more updated and luxurious feeling. The hotel is big which is probably the best feature - it has a pool; 3 resturants and a nice gym. I did also have two treatments done at the spa and was also disappointed given my expectations for the chain and the price of service. I understand in Monaco/Monte Carlo everything is much more pricey but in this case; you might be able to find a better (smaller/lesser known) hotel for the same price.,Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France,en

2018-08-23,2,This is not the glitzy; high-end place we expected.  It is a massive; standard-type big box hotel.  It took over 1 hour to check-in; we booked a king room and were sent to a room with two twin beds.  When they corrected their mistake; they sent us to a smoking handicap room but did not mention either!  We were forced to change rooms a third time; which was finally correct.  The room itself was nice; but after the horrid check-in; we are writing this hotel off,Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France,en
2018-08-23,6,Good central location; however room was not ready on arrival and went 1 hour beyond our check in time.

I requested my money back to go to any other hotel .. he literally went inside the office didnt want to talk to me .. so i got stuck with the room for the night and at the moring ( 3rd day ) i got a decent room at least .. it was the worst experience!!,barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France,en

2018-08-05,8,The hotel is great for comfort; convenience and service. The concierge was excellent.  One caveat for us though is the pool was our biggest draw when we booked because it’s beautiful and overlooks the sea. It does look like the photo  BUT; it’s like a Las Vegas nightclub from10:00 AM in the morning and all day and night.  So it’s completely inappropriate for young children.  This was very disappointing for our kids.  The hotel did shuttle us each day to the beach; but we had to pay for our beach chairs - which is normal.  We would have loved to be able to use the pool that we paid to use.,Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France,en

2018-07-17,4,From our trip to Europe we were expecting the Fairmont to be the most lavish of all of the location as it Monaco.  Unfortunately it was the worst; we ended up leaving a day early as we had enough. Don’t waste your money on ocean view rooms; you will see fishing boats and drilling out your window. Nothing magical. The Horizon restaurant which is on the top floor of the building took 20 minutes for a waiter to swing by to take a drink order in the crazy heat in July. The waitress then procedes to breaking a champagne flute near us where the shards of glass hit my husband arm and almost his eye. They didn’t broom the area where the glass shards fell which made me nervous if there were any little children. Nor did the waitress apologize or ask if we were okay. She rudely poured our drinks with major attitude on her face and body language. After we complained; the next waiter told us she was having a bad day.  After this episode; our room was ready so we went there. The hallways look like a outdate cruise ship. The rooms have not been renovated. Even the alarm clock is from the 90’s.  Not what to expect from a 4 or 5 star hotel. We knew we would be paying premium pricing for Monaco but this was them taking extreme advantages of their high end clientele. 60€ for parking a day. Cocktail drinks were in the 20€ -25€ each; a club sandwich would run you 25€; but to pay premium pricing you expect great service and nice accommodations. Unfortunately this hotel felt like a 3 star.,Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France,en
2018-07-11,10,Right on the front; amazing views; has it's own beach; all facilities including staff are well above expectations; the food in their Restaurants is up there with the best.

I would give this guy 12 out of 10; The whole experience worth every penny and we will definitely will be returning.,barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France,en
2018-07-11,10,Beautiful hotel. The suite was extremely comfortable - superb air con; spacious and spotlessly clean; very comfortable bed and bedding. The sofa bed for my son was far superior to standard sofa beds. Breakfast great with lots of choice. Lovely staff who are helpful and eager to ensure a pleasant stay. We can’t wait to come back. Thank you.,Hyatt Regency Palais,Nice,France,en
2018-07-09,4,Hotel was nice but service was horrible. They told me they would text me when room was ready; didn't happen. They told me the luggage would be in the room when room was ready it was not. They served olives; nuts to client with drinks which birds were eating out of and they knew it and didn't care! I sat at a table waiting to be addressed to take a drink/food order for over 30 minutes and finally left the pool lounge area. Parking; private beach fees were near double other 5 star hotels along the beach. Just did not provide the value I was looking for in a 5 star hotel. After I complained and heard other guest complaining as well; they offered breakfast for two days; however; breakfast had already passed so we took free breakfast for one day and it was a good breakfast but not if we paid the price they were asking; $55/person for breakfast?? They didn't clear plates; clients were waiting too long for requests... staff definitely needs training...,barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France,en

2018-01-15,10,My first time in Monaco and it couldn’t be a better experience. Every single staff member was so friendly from the valet men; receptionist; cleaners; restaurant staff to the spa staff. I could stay there for a week and not get bored. The views was beautiful; right outside the Fairmont hairpin if your an f1 fan. The cleaners did a great job of house keeping; beds were super comfy; you just melt in and fall asleep straight away. Food wise; lunch I would recommend the Horizon for a nice lunch with scenic view. The best part was Sunday Jazz Brunch at Saphir 24 restaurant. Champagne buffet €89 but this includes everything you would want to eat with a great selection of appetisers; seafood; poultry meats to dessert! Just beautiful and enjoyed it with a great live jazz band.,Fairmont Monte Carlo,Monaco,France,en
2018-01-09,10,We enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Fairmont with every staff member greeting us with professionalism and a smile.

2017-12-29,6,We stayed there twice; the second time by accident (meant to end up at the airport but got off too early  and decided to visit a restaurant we were familiar with). The hotel is across the road from the station and so convenient. The staff were pleasant on both occasions. ~On the second stay the price was significantly higher than the first. Also they had sprayed some chemical down the corridor to our room and in the room itself. It was toxic and got on our chests so that we had to sleep with the window open. They didn't offer any reduction in the price as a result even though we reported it at the desk. Overall; I wouldn't go there again.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

Parking anywhere and everywhere in Monte Carlo is very difficult; but Fairmont can handle or suggest a savings alternative if you want to climb many steps. Room placement could be important; I probably should have asked for a better location or pleaded for an upgrade but our 2 night stay just wasn't enough of an issue for me to pursue a more picturesque room or more updated style.

The check in process was very slow; and the check out process was even worse...about a 30 minute wait. The majority of the staff at the resort were not friendly. Staff at Nikki Beach pool were rude and unattentive; valet staff were snobby and were not friendly or welcoming; and they did not even open the door for us once while they were standing in front of the doors; staff at horizon never came to clear our plates at the breakfast buffet until there was a large pile of dishes in front of us; the bell boy was the only person that was friendly and took time to explain the amenities of the hotel and suggest some nice places to go in the area.

2017-05-18,4,First we checked in and we got a VERY tiny room; you could barely turn around. So we payed 100 Euros more for a normal size room per night. First night they recommended us La petite Maison. Its was very bad service. The pasta came very overcooked; even we had requested it Al Dente. Second time it came out raw. My chèvre chaud was totally melted and we didn't touch any of the dishes.The manager just stood there and didn't even come to our table even we asked for it. They charged us for full despite this. I Called the duty manager of the hotel who reluctant removed it and promised to follow up the following day. He didn't. Last day we had asked the conceirge for a reservation; that they confirmed in a letter to our room; when we came to the restaurant they never received a reservation. Aircondition in room didn't work properly and tv in bathroom not working.,barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France,en

2017-04-13,10,Value for money; excellent staff who have even contacted me to arrange to send me something I left in the room and really good cleanliness. No real downsides; some of the common areas are a bit tiered and you have to get a tube to the central area which is as cheap as chips at less than 2 euros a trip. In a nice area with lots of restaurants and the French restaurant they recommended was fantastic. I will go again.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en
2017-04-06,8,"I stayed here for just a night; and really didn't have any complaints. The rooms were clean and comfortable; the bathrooms had good water pressure; the thermostat worked. I had a nice view of the plaza in front of the train station from my window; but unfortunately; that meant that people on the plaza had a nice view of me. It was a tad far from the touristic center of Geneva but convenient if you were taking the train (like me). I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel; finding it too expensive (like most things in Switzerland!) and instead went to this lovely place called ""The Cottage"" about a seven minute walk downhill. The staff were helpful and fluent in English.",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

2016-10-29,10,First of all; the location is perfect. Less than ten minutes by train from the airport. Remember to collect the free train ticket from the airport ticket machine while waiting for your luggage to arrive. The service at the hotel was excellent. Our room on the 7th floor was much better than we expected. Great view over the city with the mountains on the background (not the Alps; though). Big balcony; more like a terrace. Had breakfast at the hotel every morning; food was fresh and good; nothing special but the atmosphere at the breakfast room was nice and the service was great. The proximity of the railway station and the bus station made it very easy to travel to Montreux and France (day trips to Chamonix and Annecy)... or just about anywhere. Will definately choose this hotel again when we come back to Genève. Merci beaucoup!,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

I'm disappointed at hotels.com for misrepresenting the room in the pictures they have on the website. Our room looked nothing like the junior room we booked. When I see a photo of a room on hotels.com I expect the room to look like that. Our room was shabby and small in comparison to the photo on hotels.com; and I would never have paid the amount I did for the room that we were given. I was told by reception it was the correct room just looked different in the photo. The hotel furniture was old and dirty.,barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France,en

2016-08-31,6,The hotel was located adjacent to the main train station and a ten minute walk from Lake Geneva. While not the most scenic area of Geneva; it was central to almost anywhere and easy to get around on foot. The staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way to help us during check-in. The room was clean; and would have been fine had it not been for the air conditioning. The air conditioning did not work; or it worked only a little; because we could hear it come out but did not feel a change in temperature. It was very hot in Geneva while we were there; and the room felt unbearably hot even after keeping the curtains closed all day long. This made sleeping extremely uncomfortable; and my friend and I could barely stay asleep at night because of the heat. This hotel would be fine to visit during the winter or cooler months; but needs to fix their a/c situation during the winter; as I would not be able to stay in that room again in warmer weather.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

2016-08-02,6,I had 2 rooms and after complaining about mice in the vent of my daughters room they were upgraded to a larger room on the last night. If I didn't persist with some sort of compensation the hotel staff wouldn't have offered me anything. I complained to the front desk via their internal phones and after waiting for 30 min for a response I had to go down and vent my frustration with the duty manager at the time ( 8.30pm approx ) to get my daughters out of that room. Upon checking out it was I who had to ask for compensation ( received 300 Euro off our account) otherwise I wouldn't have received anything. By the way even as a guest you are charged to have a sunbed near the pool; pathetic. The only highlight was the service Lionel gave us around the pool. Thank god he works there.

The front desk were excellent but we found service at their beach area terrible and at a cost of 130euros a day for two sunbeds it was definitely not good value. Noise is a problem in the guest bedrooms facing the pool. They had loud outdoor entertainment until 2am on the Friday and Saturday which meant you could not sleep until it finished. They had two wedding functions which also meant service standards slipping for resident guests.,barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France,en

We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a room with a view of the strip; which was beautifully finished with a very comfortable bed; Nespresso machine; bath and separate shower; robes etc. The maid service was first class with a turn down service every afternoon. Staff were lovely and friendly. Cocktails in the bar were very expensive (€25 ea.) but I guess that's Cannes for you! Hotel was excellently located near all of the great restaurants / shopping and only a five minute walk from the train station.

2016-03-16,6,"Ett bra hotell med utmärkt läge. Tyvärr visade det sig att frukosten som ingick var sk Continental; dvs undermålig. Vi valde att uppgradera till buffé en morgon; den var ok men inte i paritet till priset. Vår vistelse fick ett tråkigt slut; då man försökte ta fullt betalt för samtliga frukostar; vilket skulle inneburit en extra kostnad på över tusen kronor. Utcheckande receptionist kunde inte ""se"" att ngn typ av frukost skulle ingå alls. (Då vi var på väg att i frustration betala för att inte missa flyget kom den som checkat in oss och kunde snabbt ordna allt.)",Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,sv

I was upgraded to a room overlooking the square but still very quiet. Helpful staff and pleasant bar and restaurant on site. Easy walk to the Lake. The hotel backs on to a slightly sleazy area (probably very sleazy for Switzerland) but access is not a problem on the main roads. Good value for Geneva.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

2016-01-13,10,It was the last night of our road trip and we wanted to treat ourselves and stay somewhere a bit nicer. We stayed out of season so it was affordable. Beautiful hotel and great service. We called prior to arriving to ask about parking. They said not to worry and they would park the car when we arrived. They didn't; however tell us parking was 45euro a night. That is my only criticism. We could have moved the car but we felt a bit embarrassed so we left it there for the night (we didn't want to look cheap). Loved the hotel I just think they should be a bit clearer about that sort of cost because it really did add to the price of our stay as a couple who don't often frequent five star hotels. Otherwise; lovely staff. We felt very welcome,barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France,en

2015-09-30,8,Staff was great from the beginning to the end; however; certain things should be updated such as bathroom tiles; fixtures; shower; drains; etc.  We only stayed for one night so it did not bother us so much when we were given a very small room with a huge closet with a back street view because we only paid the minimum.  It was rather cozy.  They have a great selection of mini bar especially white wine; and the bed and pillows were so comfortable.  This was our last night in this vacation; and only in this hotel I could finally had a good night sleep.

2015-09-21,10,A localização do hotel é ótima; bem em frente à estação de trem. Caso tenha um vôo pela manhã os trem começam a rodar a partir de 04:40 da manhã; sendo que o tempo até o aeroporto é de 10 minutos; o que elimina a necessidade de se hospedar em um hotel perto do aeroporto. Além disso; fica próximo das principais atrações da cidade. O quarto é de um tamanho bom; mas no nosso quarto haviam colocado uma cama de solteiro (ou ela ficou do hóspede anterior); o que diminuiu muito o espaço para as malas. O banheiro possui um bom tamanho. O quarto e o banheiro estavam limpos. A recepção nos deu uma mapa da cidade e nos orientou sobre como chegar as principais atrações da cidade; o que embora não fosse necessário (eu já sabia o trajeto) foi um toque agradável; já que não tive essa atenção em nenhum outro hotel. Todos da recepção com quem tratei foram atenciosos e não tive nenhum problema com o hotel.

2015-07-15,4,We picked this hotel because of its location on the beach and were thinking of combining a bit of beach; pool and shopping. The hotel lobby and room standard are great; but we were dissappointed by the other facilities. Particularly the fact that the hotel charges €32 for half day by the pool plus €32 for half day at the beach (per person). In addition the pool is really small; packed with kids; does not have sun in the evening (5pm-ish) and 0.5l beer in the pool bar is €20. When checking out we found out that the hotel had charged us €45 per day for parking without informing us in advance. When tring to use the roof terrace which is pictured on the web page we were informed that there was no roof terrace. The breakfast in the morning was ok; but not great.

Forgetting our negative experiences: their beach while ""private"" is between 2 public beaches and is much less desirable than others on the croisette and their pool is fine but through the summer they have private events seemingly all the time even by staff accounts so if you want to swim in the midst of a cocktail party....

2015-06-28,10,I was only at the hotel for one night but found it to be a wonderful hotel with perfect location,barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France,en
2015-06-28,10,Excellent hotel but paying (a lot) extra for everything besides the room is disturbing.,barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France,en
2015-06-28,8,Arrived early so room was not ready; but was early am; so not surprising. Room was in front of Hotel; but double glazed; so no problem with noise from road. Dining room was excellent and the Maitre'd was also excellent and most helpful at all times. Front of house staff; helpful and obliging. Excellent position as over road from central Railway Station; so can get into Geneva quickly from the Airport so without problems with other types of transport. Would recommend; as central to all important places one would want to visit in Geneva.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

2015-06-08,10,30 seconds to the beach. Top class service. Very clean. Very expensive! Apart from the Carlton Hotel; this is the only place to stay in Cannes if you have the money (I was on business). Loved my stay there.,barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France,en
2015-06-08,4,Nice hotel; great location and the room was good. However overall experience was that the hotels aim was merely to get you to spend as much as possible once there. Very surprised that the hotel charges its guests to use their beach area and there is no preferential rate versus non guests. Also the pool versus web site was very disappointing.,barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France,en

2015-06-06,8,翌日ジュネーヴ空港から帰国するため、１泊だけ利用しましたが、駅が目の前なので空港への移動がラクでした。公共交通手段を無料で利用できるチケットをもらえるので、空港まで電車やバスを使って無料で行くことができます（電車で10分程度でした）。部屋は清潔で、スリッパやバスローブも完備。バスタブも大きめで、水圧も◎。日本人には嬉しいと思います。,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,ja

2015-06-02,8,Hotel is very nice. Room 214 is clean; and service is good. Only negative is a design flaw of the hotel;windows. Room 214 catches the afternoon sun which heats the aluminum window frames to a point where they are extremely warm; almost hot to the touch. It is like have a radiator running full blast in the summer. The room air conditioning is inadequate to handle this heat problem. The room is extremely uncomfortable until early morning. Suggest not book a room in the front side of the hotel until winter,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en
2015-06-02,8,Palvelu oli hyvää varsinkin hotelliin tullessa; mutta lähtöpäivänä palvelu ei enää kiinnostanut. Hotellihuoneen siivous meinasi jäädä tekemättä molempina päivinä. Oliko henkilökuntaa liian vähän? Työaika loppui ennenkuin meidän huone oli siivottu vaikka olimme olleet koko päivän poissa!!! Hotellilla oli hyvä ja keskeinen sijainti.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,fi

2015-05-09,8,We liked the hotel. It is only a two minute walk from the railway station. The staff is hospitable and very friendly. Despite a long queue at the reception on arrival it took only a couple of minutes to get the keys to our room. What we liked most is that we managed to check in earlier and that we could borrow an umbrella every time we went sighseeing. All in all  we are pleased that we chose it for our stay.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

2015-05-06,10,Location is excellent. Almost across the street from the railway station and tram and bus stops. Lots of restaurants nearby. You get a free public transportation ticket for your stay which is convenient. We rented a car for a couple of days; and there is a garage just around the corner. You validate your ticket at the reception. There is also a choice of continental and buffet breakfasts.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

2015-05-04,8,Our check-in was fast and the staff very pleasant as well as efficient. Unfortunately; the room was not ready and we waited quite a long time in the lobby.  They explained that  they had had a large checkout.  The room was on the 1st floor and had a street view which was interesting in the day time.  However; at night; one could hear all the cars and the party goers up until 2-3 am.  I am sure a higher room would be much better.  The carpet seemed new and all the furnishings were very modern.  The  bathroom was well supplied.  There was lots of   underground shopping was right under  the building as well as across the side  street.  The street cars ran right by the door and the big Geneva train station entrance  was about 1/2 a block away-- so easy for the airport transfers.  Tour company ticket booths; Lac Leman  and the fountain were a few blocks away. The big shopping area an easy walk as well.  The Front Desk gave us a voucher for free local travel on the public transportation.  This could used to go to the airport on departure day. I would recommend this hotel.,Warwick Geneva,Geneva,Switzerland,en

2014-09-19,6,You know what to expect in Cannes - crazy prices and properties that are stuck in a time warp. This was my second time at the Majestic - the outside of the hotel is lovely; lobby is gilded and elegant; and Le Fouquet is nice but over the top expensive; but unless you get a modernized room; be prepared to be very disappointed. Room service charges 15 euros for silverware; Diet Coke from the minibar is 11 euros; wifi with a very weak signal is 15 euros per day. You get the idea. Best reason to stay at the Majestic is that it is literally 2 blocks from Palais des Festivals.,barriere-le-majestic,Cannes,France,en
